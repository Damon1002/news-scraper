      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Can Hedge Against Selling Pressure on US Bonds</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27028</link>
      <description>August 31st. As per CoinDesk, André Dragosch, the European Research Director at Bitwise Asset Management, mentioned that when the stock market is in a downturn, gold serves as the most effective hedge. Meanwhile, Bitcoin demonstrates more resilience when the U.S. bond market is under pressure. Historical data and industry research also back this perspective: gold generally rises during stock market bear markets, while Bitcoin performs better during U.S. Treasury sell-offs.By 2025, the price of gold has increased by more than 30%, and Bitcoin has risen by approximately 16.46%. This reflects the significantly different roles that the two assets play when investors consider rising yields, stock market volatility, and Trump&apos;s support for cryptocurrency.</description>

      <title>If Bitcoin surpasses $110,000, the mainstream CEX&apos;s total short liquidation volume will reach $514 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27027</link>
      <description>On August 31st, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $110,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will reach 514 million.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $108,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will reach 171 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the price of the underlying asset will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will experience a more intense reaction due to the liquidity shock wave after reaching that level.</description>
