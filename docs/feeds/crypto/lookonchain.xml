      <title>Fitch: Affirms U.S. &apos;AA+&apos; Rating, Outlook Stable</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25860</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, Fitch Ratings has recently affirmed the United States&apos; rating as &quot;AA+&quot; with a stable outlook. Fitch pointed out that the U.S. sovereign rating benefits from its large economic scale, high per capita income, vibrant business environment, and the special financing flexibility brought by the U.S. dollar serving as the global primary reserve currency.Nevertheless, this rating is restricted by high fiscal deficits, a heavy interest burden, and a high and ascending government debt level. The United States has not yet taken significant actions to address its large fiscal imbalances, the growing debt burden, and the imminent expenditure growth related to an aging population.Fitch forecasts that driven by a substantial increase in revenue, the government deficit as a percentage of GDP is anticipated to decline from 7.7% in 2024 to 6.9% in 2025, then rise to 7.8% of GDP in 2026, and further increase to 7.9% of GDP in 2027.

      <title>Powell&apos;s &quot;Dovish&quot; Tone Loud and Clear, Probability of Fed Rate Cut in September Rises to 85.2%</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25858</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said that the continuously &quot;evolving&quot; economic risks have given the Fed a more compelling reason to cut interest rates. This statement shows that Powell has joined the &quot;dovish&quot; camp within the Federal Open Market Committee responsible for setting rates, and it also implies that he may signal his support for a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed&apos;s next meeting in September.According to CME FedWatch, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed in September has increased to 85.2% (from around 75% before Powell&apos;s speech), while the probability of rates remaining unchanged is 14.8%.</description>
