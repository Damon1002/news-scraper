      <title>Trader Eugene: I have once again gone long on ETH, not advisable to quickly switch to a short position</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22904</link>
      <description>On August 2nd, Trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio posted on his personal channel, indicating that he has once again taken a long position on ETH. The bullish sentiment in August was hyped prematurely by the market. However, $113,000 for BTC and $3,500 for ETH are still reasonable entry points, with stop-loss set below $112,000 and $3,400 respectively.Although the hype about Data Availability Technology (DAT) may gradually wane, there is still significant structural buying interest in the current market. Therefore, it is not advisable to switch to a bearish outlook too hastily. Many people have been constantly jumping back and forth between &quot;bull market return&quot; and &quot;total collapse,&quot; yet they fail to realize that the market does not follow a simple binary path.</description>
