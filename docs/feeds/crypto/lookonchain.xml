      <title>Nearly 600 Economists Call for Defending Federal Reserve Independence, Co-sign Open Letter in Support of Powell</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27400</link>
      <description>September 2nd: After U.S. President Trump attempted to dismiss Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook due to suspicion of mortgage fraud, a significant number of prominent economists have expressed support for her.

The open letter was released on Tuesday and its signatories encompass Nobel laureates Claudia Goldin and Paul Romer, the former chair of the Obama administration&apos;s Council of Economic Advisers Christina Romer, as well as Ohio State University professor Trevon Logan, who co-authored a paper with Cook.
