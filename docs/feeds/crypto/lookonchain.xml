      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $116,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation volume will reach $2.078 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24791</link>
      <description>On August 15th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin drops below $116,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach $2.078 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin exceeds $120,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach $938 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the precise number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, it will trigger a stronger response due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>
