      <title>Analyst: Fed Meeting Minutes &quot;Outdated,&quot; Focus on Powell&apos;s Friday Jackson Hole Speech</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25529</link>
      <description>August 21st. The minutes from the Fed&apos;s July meeting indicated that policymakers&apos; worries about high inflation surpassed their concerns regarding a slowdown in the labor market, resulting in a slight rise in the US dollar. It was noted in the minutes that &quot;the majority of participants assessed that the risks to inflation were skewed towards the upside in comparison to the risks to a decelerating labor market.&quot; This meeting took place prior to the release of the July US nonfarm payroll data, which showed job figures for July that were weaker than anticipated.A Danske Bank analyst stated in a report that this implies that the Fed minutes were &quot;somewhat out of date,&quot; and the market reaction was relatively limited. Currently, the market&apos;s focus has shifted to Fed Chair Powell&apos;s speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Symposium. (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>glassnode: Bitcoin Inflow Shows Exhaustion, Crypto Four-Year Cycle May Still Hold</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25524</link>
      <description>On August 21st, the latest market analysis report from glassnode indicated that there are signs of the exhaustion of Bitcoin&apos;s capital inflow. Even though the price reached a new high of $124,400, the demand is weakening. While this demand slowdown was occurring, speculative positions surged. The open interest in major altcoin futures contracts once reached a record high of $60 billion and then pulled back by $2.5 billion.Ethereum, which has long been considered a barometer of the &quot;altcoin season,&quot; has once again become the barometer of this round of volatility. Its hodler dominance has risen to the fourth-highest level in history, while the perpetual contract trading dominance has surged to a new high of 67%, marking the strongest structural shift to date.From a cyclical perspective, Bitcoin&apos;s price action also echoes previous patterns. In both the 2015-2018 and 2018-2022 cycles, measured from the cycle low, Bitcoin&apos;s peak price was only delayed by 2-3 months compared to our curre</description>

A fraudster posed as a senior UK police officer and managed to steal ï¿¡2.1 million (approximately $2.8 million) worth of Bitcoin.The police declared that this was a &quot;highly targeted and sophisticated fraud.&quot; The fraudster might have acquired victim information through a data breach. The fraudster claimed to have arrested a suspect in possession of the victim&apos;s identification and used this to generate panic and a sense of urgency. The victim, believing they were following police instructions, logged into a cold wallet via a link provided by the fraudster.
