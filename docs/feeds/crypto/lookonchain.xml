      <title>Trump: Powell Refusing Interest Rate Cut, American Families Are Being Hurt</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21542</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, U.S. President Trump posted on his personal social platform and said, &quot;Our country&apos;s housing issue is falling behind due to &apos;Mr. Too Late&apos; Powell&apos;s refusal to reduce interest rates. Families are suffering because the interest rates are too high. Even our country itself is paying more interest than it should - all because of this &apos;Mr. Too Late.&apos; &quot;Our interest rates should be three percentage points lower than they are currently, which would save the country one trillion dollars a year. This obstinate person just doesn&apos;t understand - didn&apos;t understand before and won&apos;t understand in the future. The Federal Reserve Board should take action, but they don&apos;t have the courage to do it!</description>
