      <title>AguilaTrades has closed a long position, realizing a profit of $11.3 million</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23860</link>
      <description>August 9th. Based on EmberCN&apos;s monitoring, the whale contract trader AguilaTrades closed his long positions on BTC and ETH just 10 minutes ago, completing a trade that lasted only 2 days. During this long position, he expanded his initial $4.6 million capital to $15.9 million, thereby achieving a $11.3 million profit.Previously, AguilaTrades had witnessed substantial unrealized gains after opening positions, but each time he decided to compound those gains, which led to higher leverage. Minor retracements ate away at the gains, and eventually, he lost his initial capital. After this $11.3 million profit, AguilaTrades&apos; total losses have been reduced from $40 million to $28.7 million.</description>

      <title>Wang Feng: Ethereum&apos;s Rise Is Not Isolated in the Market, Cryptocurrency Autumn Is Expected to Begin</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23858</link>
      <description>August 9th: Wang Feng, the founder of Blueport Interactive, mentioned in a post that the market sentiment of Bitcoin and Ethereum should not be regarded in isolation. Currently, Bitcoin is trading sideways around $120,000 with little volatility and no significant sell-off by institutions. This situation offers ample space for Ethereum to maintain its uptrend after breaking through $4,000, and it is forecasted to rise to at least around $5,000. Similarly, Ethereum and the entire crypto market have always been interrelated. The cryptocurrency autumn is expected to commence, with DeFi, RWA, and star meme coins entering a stage of takeoff.On July 16th, Blueport Interactive established the LK Crypto Division to be responsible for the management of the company&apos;s mainstream crypto assets and expedite its Web3 and RWA strategies.</description>
