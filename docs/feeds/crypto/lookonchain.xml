      <title>BlackRock&apos;s Securitize CEO: RWA Tokenization Represents $20 Trillion Market Potential, Ethereum Leads the Space</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26434</link>
      <description>August 27th. The CEO of Securitize, Carlos Domingo, under the Belldex brand, made a post via the Ethereum official X account. He stated that Real World Assets (RWA) represent a market potential exceeding $20 trillion, yet only a small fraction of it is on-chain. In terms of market value, Ethereum is the leading blockchain in the RWA field, but we are still in the early stages. Even a 1% market share could bring an opportunity of over $200 billion.Domingo pointed out that Securitize mints on-chain native assets, with 68% (over $23 billion) on Ethereum. Many issuers believe that Ethereum provides the safest, most composable, and censorship-resistant foundation for tokenized financial products. Tokenized stocks are the next step in bringing real-world financial markets onto the blockchain. Since the global stock market is valued at approximately $100 trillion, it is difficult to overstate the long-term opportunity of anchoring these assets on Ethereum.</description>
