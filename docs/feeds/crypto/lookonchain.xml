      <title>Federal Reserve Governor Cook Faces New Mortgage Fraud Allegations Today</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26801</link>
      <description>August 29th: On this day, Mark Pullen, who is the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, once more submitted another criminal charge regarding the third property of Federal Reserve Board Governor Cook in Massachusetts to the Department of Justice. The charge asserts that Cook obtained a mortgage of $361,000 for an apartment in Massachusetts and claimed it as a second home. Eight months later, Cook claimed to have received rental income ranging from $15,000 to $50,000 and classified it as an investment property.Cook may be engaged in Reverse Occupancy Fraud. In this type of fraud, a borrower purchases a property as an investment but initially falsely represents it as a primary or secondary residence in order to obtain a lower mortgage rate or more favorable loan terms. Subsequently, the borrower may change the property&apos;s use by declaring rental income to conform to the definition of an investment property.BlockBeats had previously reported that a judge in charge of the case</description>

      <title>Matrixport appeared at Bitcoin Asia2025 to discuss how Asian institutions are leading the way in seizing new opportunities in Bitcoin.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26799</link>
      <description>On August 29th, Matrixport was extended an invitation to attend the Bitcoin Asia Summit and took part in a panel discussion entitled &quot;Asian Institutions Leading the Commencement of a New Bitcoin Era.&quot;During the event, Matrixport&apos;s COO, Cynthia Wu, pointed out that the digital asset investment is undergoing a substantial transformation. An increasing number of investors and corporate treasuries are regarding Bitcoin as a long-term asset allocation. They are continuously accumulating rather than engaging in short-term speculation. ETFs and stock tokens have made it more accessible for the general public to invest in digital assets, significantly reducing the learning curve. In just two years, the combined market value of these two has exceeded $260 billion and is approaching the current market capitalization of stablecoins. It can be anticipated that with the proliferation of stablecoins, the market capitalization of Bitcoin still has the potential to grow tenfold in the coming years.</description>
