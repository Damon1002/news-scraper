      <title>TD Cowen maintains a Strategy of a $680 Price Target, predicts it will Hold 4.3% of the BTC Total Supply in 2027</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25100</link>
      <description>On August 19th, the investment bank TD Cowen maintained its bullish target price at $680 for Strategy. It predicted that by the end of 2027, Strategy would accumulate 4.3% of the total Bitcoin supply (that is, 900,000 coins), and the price of Bitcoin would reach $232,000. The current trading price of MSTR is $363, with the Bitcoin price above $116,000.Today, Strategy announced that it had relaxed its equity sale financing restrictions, allowing the issuance of common stock when the stock price is below 2.5 times its corresponding Bitcoin holdings. This move has triggered market controversy. Analysts at TD Bank expressed that the financing restrictions were initially implemented as a defensive strategy to protect the value of reserve assets but had now transformed into an opportunistic strategy aimed at accelerating shareholder value creation.</description>

      <title>Strategy to Relax Equity Sale Funding Limitation, Allowing Ordinary Shares Issuance When Stock Price is Less Than 2.5 Times Bitcoin Holdings</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25095</link>
      <description>On August 19th, as per Bloomberg, it is reported that MicroStrategy has seemingly loosened its equity sale financing constraints. This enables the issuance of common stock when the stock price is lower than 2.5 times its corresponding Bitcoin holdings. This provides MicroStrategy with greater flexibility in raising funds to acquire more BTC.Some proponents view this development with an optimistic attitude. They believe that the relaxation of the rules indicates MicroStrategy&apos;s long-term bullish stance on Bitcoin. By being able to raise funds at a lower cost, it may potentially further boost the price of Bitcoin. On the other hand, opposing market participants argue that since November 2024, MicroStrategy&apos;s Bitcoin premium has decreased from 3.4 times to 1.6 times. Lowering the financing restriction will further dilute shareholders&apos; equity.</description>
