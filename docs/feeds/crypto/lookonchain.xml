      <title>White House Crypto Report Suggests Avoiding Double Taxation, Bitcoin Miners to Be Taxed Only Upon Sale</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23261</link>
      <description>On August 5th, the Digital Asset Work Group of the U.S. White House suggested in a 168-page cryptocurrency report that the IRS clarify the tax timing of Bitcoin mining income. It is possible to change it to be taxed at the time of sale in order to avoid double taxation of &quot;mining income tax + capital gains on sale.&quot;BitFuFu CEO Leo Lu stated that this action could substantially reduce the tax burden of miners and promote the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. Congress has already witnessed bills such as H.R. 8149 proposing similar tax deferral schemes.</description>

      <title>On-chain Transaction Engine Decibel Launches on Aptos, Reshaping Decentralized Market Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23260</link>
      <description>On August 5th, the new decentralized trading engine, Decibel, which is supported by Aptos Labs and the Decibel Foundation, was officially launched today. The platform is designed to offer a neutral and composable core infrastructure for the global on-chain market. It integrates spot trading, perpetual contracts, and yield strategies and will serve as the execution layer within the Aptos financial ecosystem.As the demand for decentralized finance continues to rise, the market still heavily depends on fragmented platforms and third-party exchanges, resulting in the dispersion of liquidity and limited composability. By leveraging the Aptos blockchain, Decibel supports multi-collateral cross-margin accounts, a self-custody architecture, and programmable incentive mechanisms. This provides traders, developers, and institutions with unified liquidity management, direct order flow, and real-time data access, enhancing the efficiency of fund circulation and the trading execution experience.</description>
