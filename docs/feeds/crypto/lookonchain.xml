      <title>Trump: Non-Farm Payrolls Data Was Manipulated to Embarrass Me</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22865</link>
      <description>On August 2nd, U.S. President Trump&apos;s latest social media message reads: &quot;In my opinion, today&apos;s employment data has been manipulated in order to embarrass Republicans and me. Just like they did around the 2024 presidential election. Firstly, they presented three days of good data. Then, on November 15th, 2024, shortly after the election, that data was significantly revised downward. It&apos;s a complete fraud.&quot;&quot;Too late, Mr. Powell&quot; is not in a good situation either! But the good news is that our country is performing very well! (FXStreet)</description>

      <description>August 2nd: The Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing that Fed Governor Lael Brainard will tender her resignation next week. This gives President Trump an early chance to potentially appoint a preferred candidate who could assume a leadership role at the central bank. Brainard&apos;s position was not scheduled to become vacant until January of next year, and the 7-member Federal Reserve Board currently has no other vacant positions.Now, Trump will be able to promptly appoint a new governor to exert pressure on Chairman Powell—this governor may potentially succeed Powell. The statement noted that Brainard has submitted her resignation to President Trump and will step down next Friday, August 8th, in order to return to Georgetown University as a professor.Brainard did not participate in this week&apos;s Federal Reserve policy meeting. The Board stated that her absence was due to personal reasons. Brainard previously served as the Chief Economist at the U.S. Department of Labor and was</description>

      <title>CNBC: Crypto Market Enters Turbulent August as Trump&apos;s New Tariffs Spark Risk-Off Sentiment</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22862</link>
      <description>On August 2nd, as per the report by CNBC, the crypto market witnessed a decline on Friday following Trump&apos;s announcement of &quot;reciprocal&quot; tariff adjustments for dozens of countries. Bitcoin&apos;s price demonstrated relative strength, while Ethereum, XRP, and BNB all underwent minor drops. Bitcoin once dropped to a low of $113,988.47.This decline led to a widespread long liquidation, with traders being compelled to sell assets at the market price to repay debts, thereby further driving down the price.Crypto-related stocks experienced even greater declines. Coinbase took the lead in the decline due to its poor second-quarter performance, falling by 15%; Circle declined by 4%, Galaxy Digital fell by 2%, the Ethereum treasury company Bitmine Immersion dropped by 8%, and MicroStrategy fell by 5%.</description>
