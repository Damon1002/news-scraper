      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Support Located in $109,600 to $106,800 High Demand Zone</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25327</link>
      <description>On August 20th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel posted on social media, indicating that this pullback is relatively gentle. Bitcoin has only dropped by 8% from its local peak. The mid-term support is at the 111-day moving average ($109,600), and the short-term holder realized price is ($106,800). This area forms a dense area of demand, and it is anticipated that there will be attempts at stabilization and a rebound in this zone.</description>

      <title>Analysis: The U.S. Treasury is set to withdraw $500-600 billion in cash from the market over the next two months, potentially leading to increased market illiquidity.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25326</link>
      <description>August 20th. The Delphi Digital Market Research Institute put out an article indicating that in the forthcoming weeks, the US Treasury Department will commence replenishing its General Account (TGA). This process will withdraw $500–600 billion in cash from the market over approximately two months. On the surface, this might seem ordinary. However, the current period is evolving into one of the most fragile liquidity environments of the past decade.In 2023, the $550 billion TGA replenishment was cushioned by more than $2 trillion of Fed reverse repo tools, healthy bank reserves, and strong overseas bond demand. Now, these cushions have disappeared. The Fed is still consuming liquidity through Quantitative Tightening (QT). Reverse repos are almost depleted. Banks are restricted by losses and capital rules. Overseas buyers from China to Japan have also withdrawn. As a result, every dollar raised by the Treasury Department this fall will be directly drawn from active market liquidity.H</description>

      <title>Institution: Powell to Open Door to September Rate Cut at Jackson Hole</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25324</link>
      <description>On August 20th, MainSky Asset Management Company declared that Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is likely to open the door to a rate cut in September during the upcoming Jackson Hole Symposium. The chairman of the MainSky Board, Eckhard Schulte, stated that, in contrast to last year&apos;s meeting when Powell prepared the market for a 50-basis-point rate cut, this time the cut is anticipated to be only 25 basis points. He pointed out: &quot;Unlike last year, the current monetary policy is closer to the &apos;neutral rate,&apos; thus there is no requirement for a rapid and significant rate hike to achieve normalization.&quot; MainSky anticipates that there will be at least one more rate cut in the fourth quarter of this year.

      <title>If Bitcoin surpasses $115,000, the mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation pressure will reach $1.122 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25322</link>
      <description>On August 20th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $115,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $1.122 billion.On the other hand, if Bitcoin drops below $112,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $882 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the underlying price will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>Analysis: The main force behind this round of Ethereum short selling is suspected to be a hedge fund</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25321</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Ethereum recently experienced a significant surge and reached nearly $5,000, which triggered a bullish rally. Nevertheless, this crucial level was not successfully broken through as sellers once again took the upper hand and forced the price to decline. A considerable amount of the downward pressure seems to originate from large hedge funds that continue to have heavy short positions in the second-largest cryptocurrency.When the Ethereum price exceeded $4,000, the number of short positions also started to rise. Many market participants expected the upward momentum to weaken. A large number of these short positions were led by major hedge funds, further intensifying the downward pressure on Ethereum. This is not an isolated incident as hedge funds have been trying to suppress the ETH price in an attempt to reduce their own losses.According to The Block&apos;s &quot;CME Ether Futures Net Position&quot; dashboard, these short positions have reached a historic high. Only hedge funds s</description>

      <title>Bank of America: Stablecoin&apos;s Disruptive Application in Cross-Border P2P Payments Could Generate Up to $75 Billion in Annualized or Trigger High Demand</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25320</link>
      <description>On August 20th, according to ChainNews, a recent research report from Bank of America conducted a detailed analysis of the potential transformative influence of stablecoins in the financial system. It was pointed out that this digital asset, although facing regulatory disputes, has already shown unique advantages in areas such as cross-border transactions and retail settlements. The report clearly stated that peer-to-peer (P2P) cross-border payments are the most disruptive application scenario for stablecoins. Compared to the traditional banking system, its settlement efficiency and cost advantages are significant, making it a key channel for fund flows in emerging markets.It is worth noting that Shopify&apos;s move to allow merchants to accept USDC stablecoin has been regarded as a landmark event for retail penetration. More recently, the on-chain completion of USTs tokenized bond repurchase transactions has further highlighted institutional investors&apos; recognition of the stablecoin&apos;s set</description>

      <title>Coinbase to Provide Tiered USDC Subsidy for Unfilled Futures Positions</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25318</link>
      <description>On August 20th, according to the community host Super Jun of BlockBeats, Coinbase&apos;s derivatives product updated a new feature today. It provides a staggered USDC subsidy based on users&apos; open contract positions.Super Jun stated, &quot;This subsidy is directly comparable to funding rate products like BFUSD and USDE. For instance, if a user has a $1 million USDC collateral and opens a contract worth $2 million, then the user&apos;s $1 million USDC collateral will naturally obtain an annualized return of 8%. If a user has $10 million USDC collateral and opens a $20 million contract, then the user&apos;s $10 million USDC will receive an annualized return of 12%.&quot;</description>
