      <title>Wang Feng: ETH Leading the Market in the Short Term, Funds Will Eventually Flow Back to BTC to Realize Profits</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26122</link>
      <description>On August 25th, Wang Feng, the founder of Blueport Interactive, tweeted that the recent &quot;ETH outperforming while BTC is in a sideways movement&quot; is more of a difference in narrative rhythm. The opportunity window may be short-lived, and investors may not have enough time to complete position adjustments.In the medium to long term, both share the same pool of macro funds, the same set of regulatory dividends, and the same market value curve. ETH should be regarded as a Î² amplifier of BTC rather than a substitute.Historical experience has shown that during the 2017 ICO and the 2020 DeFi cycles, the heat of ETH actually enhanced the risk premium of BTC. ETH is leverage, and BTC is an anchor. Large funds will ultimately flow back to BTC to cash out profits after the carnival.</description>

      <title>The probability of a 25 basis point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September has decreased to 87.3%.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26119</link>
      <description>On August 25th, based on the CME&apos;s &quot;FedWatch Tool&quot;, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed in September has dropped to 87.3%, while the probability of keeping rates unchanged is 12.7%.Former Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida previously indicated in a report that the Fed appears ready to cut the policy rate soon but will do it with caution. Powell&apos;s highly anticipated speech last week at the annual Jackson Hole symposium did not let the market down, and the Fed&apos;s revised monetary policy framework did not surprise Fed observers. Looking ahead, the Fed reaffirmed its commitment to its dual mandate and only made minor clarifications to its monetary policy framework.</description>

Citigroup&apos;s new base forecasts for the two-year US Treasury bond yield are 3.50%; the five-year bond yield is 3.65%, and the 30-year bond yield is 4.70%. (FXStreet)</description>
