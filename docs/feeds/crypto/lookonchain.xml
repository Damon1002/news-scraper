      <title>Trump: Powell Refusing Interest Rate Cut, American Families Are Being Hurt</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21542</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, U.S. President Trump posted on his personal social platform and said, &quot;Our country&apos;s housing issue is falling behind due to &apos;Mr. Too Late&apos; Powell&apos;s refusal to reduce interest rates. Families are suffering because the interest rates are too high. Even our country itself is paying more interest than it should - all because of this &apos;Mr. Too Late.&apos; &quot;Our interest rates should be three percentage points lower than they are currently, which would save the country one trillion dollars a year. This obstinate person just doesn&apos;t understand - didn&apos;t understand before and won&apos;t understand in the future. The Federal Reserve Board should take action, but they don&apos;t have the courage to do it!</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21543</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen declared that the current administration is &quot;not in a hurry&quot; to decide on the successor to Fed Chair Powell, and the potential candidate could come from current Board members or regional bank presidents. Yellen stated on a TV program on Wednesday: &quot;There are numerous strong candidates, including several key Board members and perhaps regional bank presidents.&quot; She did not disclose any specific names.Reports have suggested that Yellen herself, White House National Economic Council Director Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and current Fed Governor Wall are among the candidates put forward by Trump for the chairmanship. Yellen said: &quot;There is an extremely long, extremely long list.&quot; She further stated: &quot;I will not be discussing this process. However, we are advancing with this process. Obviously, it will be President Trump&apos;s decision, and we are not in a rush.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>Analysis: The massive ETH queue for unbonding may be related to the sudden drop in Ethereum supply on Aave, and if it worsens, it could lead to stETH becoming untethered.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21537</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, the cryptocurrency Key Opinion Leader (KOL) darkpools posted an analysis on social media, stating that the recent reason for the 620,000 ETH queued for unstaking might be as follows: A whale withdrew ETH deposits from Aave (reducing the supply of ETH), resulting in the ETH utilization rate on Aave soaring, leading to a sharp increase in the borrowing rate of ETH; Users using stETH for looping faced unprofitability due to high costs, prompting them to reduce leverage; A large amount of de-leveraged stETH entered the staking withdrawal queue; Some users chose to directly sell stETH to avoid the withdrawal queue, causing stETH to deviate by 30 basis points (0.3%).Due to the fact that the oracle price of stETH is based on the redemption value rather than the market price, lenders are currently stuck in their positions and may need to wait for up to about 18 days, which is the current ETH unstaking queue time. If the situation continues to deteriorate, stETH may face liquida</description>
