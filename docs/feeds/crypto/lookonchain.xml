      <title>Berachain Co-founder: ICO and Public Sale Will Make a Comeback, Large-scale Airdrops Pose More Harm than Good</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26045</link>
      <description>August 24th. Berachain&apos;s co-founder Smokey stated that &quot;When there is a larger-scale airdrop, there will be a greater number of potential sellers with no cost basis. Many large Asia-Pacific trading teams often specifically short tokens with airdrops. Additionally, airdropped tokens are easily influenced by the market, and most end up in the hands of insiders. ICOs and public sales are likely to make a significant comeback. For most teams in the future, the most prudent approach is to conduct a very small airdrop (1-2%), while also having a public sale (perhaps accounting for 5-10%).&quot;</description>

      <title>1confirmation Founder: Ethereum&apos;s Institutional Holding Structure Healthier Than Bitcoin&apos;s</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26040</link>
      <description>On August 24th, Nick Tomaino, who is the founder of the crypto venture capital firm 1confirmation, put up a message saying, &quot;The crucial defect of Strategy is that Michael Saylor holds 10% of the company&apos;s equity but wields 45% of the voting rights. Meanwhile, the company holds 3.3% of the total Bitcoin supply. He shows up on TV every day as a &apos;Bitcoin spokesperson.&apos; Clearly, Wall Street doesn&apos;t want him to become wealthier.&quot;In contrast, Tom Lee&apos;s stake is significantly smaller than Michael Saylor&apos;s. And companies like SBET, ETHZ, and GAME are making headway without anyone cornering the Ethereum holdings. This is precisely why Wall Street and the public will offer support to ETH in a manner distinct from BTC.</description>
