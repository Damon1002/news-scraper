      <title>Analysis: Ethereum Surge Driven by Skyrocketing Structural Demand</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21531</link>
      <description>July 23rd. Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer of Bitwise, stated in an internal memo on July 22nd that Ethereum is currently facing a &quot;demand shock.&quot; Since May 15th, ETFs and newly established corporate treasuries have purchased approximately 2.83 million ETH, with a total value of around $10 billion—32 times the output of the Ethereum network during this period. This supply-demand gap is likely to continue to widen.Hougan said that Ethereum has increased by more than 65% in the past month and more than 160% since April. He believes that this growth is mainly driven by a supply-demand imbalance rather than a change in market sentiment. Hougan compared this situation to the Bitcoin market in 2024. Since the launch of the US spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024, Wall Street funds, publicly traded companies (such as Strategy and Trump Media), and even some national governments have collectively purchased more than 1.5 million BTC, while only about 300,000 BTC were mined during the sa</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21528</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, based on Coinglass data, the current funding rates of mainstream CEX and DEX show that the market remains in a neutral position. The specific funding rates for mainstream coins are presented in the attached image.BlockBeats Note: The funding rate is a fee set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price. It is usually applicable to perpetual contracts and is a fund exchange mechanism between long and short traders. The trading platform does not charge this fee. It is used to adjust the cost or profit of traders holding contracts to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.When the funding rate is 0.01%, it represents the baseline rate. When the funding rate is greater than 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market. When the funding rate is less than 0.005%, it indicates a generally bearish market.</description>
