      <title>Matrixport: Bitcoin Retraces to Key Range, Potential Further Drop Ahead</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27144</link>
      <description>On September 1st, Matrixport disclosed its latest report on social media, indicating that Bitcoin has pulled back to the range of $106,000 - $108,000, a level that it has been closely observing. In its recent report, Matrixport has adopted a more cautious stance and cautioned that a retest of $108,000 might just be the starting point. Since late July, Matrixport has been highlighting the increasing resistance resulting from seasonal weakness.Now, as this week&apos;s US employment data is about to be released and Bitcoin is at a crucial technical level, the market is setting the stage for a potential significant rally. While many traders would be astonished by further Bitcoin downside, this situation cannot be excluded. Rate cuts are often regarded as the driving force for pushing cryptocurrency prices higher, but they rarely occur without consequences.</description>

      <title>Viewpoint: Inflation Data Intensifies Market Bearish Sentiment, Bitcoin&apos;s Key Psychological Support Level at $100,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27135</link>
      <description>On September 1st, Vincent Liu, the CIO of Kronos Research, stated that the inflation data has intensified the bearish market sentiment. This sentiment initially emerged after a series of large-scale Bitcoin whale sell-offs triggered the liquidation of leveraged positions.Vincent Liu believes: &quot;The key psychological support level of Bitcoin is at $100,000. With leveraged positions under pressure, it highlights the fragility of its liquidity.&quot; He also added that the key support level of Ethereum is at $4,000. &quot;If these support levels are breached, it could trigger further declines and more widespread liquidity tightening. However, a true bear market requires a more sustained decline.&quot;Regarding this week&apos;s non-farm payroll data, Vincent Liu stated, &quot;A significant surprise in job growth could trigger sharp market volatility. Strong data could pressure the cryptocurrency as risk appetite wanes, while weaker-than-expected data could boost demand.&quot; (The Block)</description>
