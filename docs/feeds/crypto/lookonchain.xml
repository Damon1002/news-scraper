      <description>September 3rd: Figure, the first stock of RWA, intends to raise $526 million through an Initial Public Offering (IPO), with a valuation exceeding $4 billion, joining the trend of blockchain companies like Circle, Bullish, and Gemini going public.

      <title>Nvidia Denies H100/H200 Chip Shortage Rumors: Ample Inventory to Instantly Meet Order Demand</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27413</link>
      <description>September 3rd, Nvidia (NVDA.O) declared that the recent media reports regarding the &quot;limited supply&quot; and &quot;sold out&quot; rumors about Nvidia&apos;s H100/H200 chips are all inaccurate. As detailed in the financial report, while cloud service partners are indeed capable of leasing all of their H100/H200 chips online, this does not imply that Nvidia is unable to accept new orders. With an ample stock of H100/H200, they can promptly fulfill all order requirements. Rumors suggesting that the H20 chip is cutting into the supply of H100/H200 or Blackwell products are also entirely unfounded—sales of the H20 chip will never have an impact on Nvidia&apos;s supply capabilities for other products.
