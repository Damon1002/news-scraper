      <title>Matrixport: Bitcoin Retraces to Key Range, Potential Further Drop Ahead</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27144</link>
      <description>On September 1st, Matrixport disclosed its latest report on social media, indicating that Bitcoin has pulled back to the range of $106,000 - $108,000, a level that it has been closely observing. In its recent report, Matrixport has adopted a more cautious stance and cautioned that a retest of $108,000 might just be the starting point. Since late July, Matrixport has been highlighting the increasing resistance resulting from seasonal weakness.Now, as this week&apos;s US employment data is about to be released and Bitcoin is at a crucial technical level, the market is setting the stage for a potential significant rally. While many traders would be astonished by further Bitcoin downside, this situation cannot be excluded. Rate cuts are often regarded as the driving force for pushing cryptocurrency prices higher, but they rarely occur without consequences.</description>
