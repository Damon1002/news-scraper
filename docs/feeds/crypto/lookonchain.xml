      <title>Thomas Lee: Today&apos;s ETH is like 2017&apos;s Bitcoin, and there will be regrets for those who do not bet on it at this moment</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23433</link>
      <description>On August 6th, Thomas Lee, the chairman of the board of BitMine (BMNR), once again expressed his bullish view on Ethereum. He said, &quot;Many people wish they had doubled down on Bitcoin in 2017 when the price was below $1,000. Now, the price is $114,000. Today&apos;s Ethereum will experience a similar moment in 2025.&quot;Thomas Lee stated yesterday, &quot;BMNR currently holds 833,133 ETH, which is worth $3 billion. This makes it the world&apos;s largest ETH treasury and the world&apos;s third-largest cryptocurrency treasury. As Wall Street financializes blockchain and AI drives the tokenization of robotic assets, ETH will still be one of the biggest macro trends in the next 10 to 15 years.&quot;</description>
