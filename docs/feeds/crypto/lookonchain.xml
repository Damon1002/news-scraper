      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $116,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation volume will reach $2.078 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24791</link>
      <description>On August 15th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin drops below $116,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach $2.078 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin exceeds $120,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach $938 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the precise number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, it will trigger a stronger response due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>

This is the latest indication that he is preparing to significantly expand the tariff system.Trump stated on Friday while on Air Force One on his way to a summit with Russian President Putin in Alaska, &quot;I will decide on the tariffs for steel and chips next week and the week after.

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24787</link>
      <description>On August 15th, as per an official announcement, Qubic declared that it had attained over 51% hash rate control on the Monero network. This led to the reorganization of 6 blocks and the creation of 60 orphan blocks. Initial reports suggest that within a span of two hours, Qubic mined 80% of Monero&apos;s total blocks.During this period, approximately 750 XMR and 7 million XTM were mined. The unsold Tari from the previous round, combined with 7 million XTM, which amounts to 17.2 billion QUBIC, were burned at an average price of around 3,200 QUBIC per billion, equivalent to approximately $55,000. Compute nodes and miners jointly received rewards of 62.2 billion QUBIC, valued at around $200,000.The network&apos;s peak hash rate reached 2.71 GH/s, accounting for 52% of the global Monero hash rate. A total of 5,506 Monero blocks were mined. Data indicates that Qubic&apos;s current miner revenue is nearly four times that of Monero. The 51% Monero experiment is still in progress.</description>
