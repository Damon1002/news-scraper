      <title>Arthur Hayes: If Powell delivers a hawkish speech tonight, ETH may retest $4000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25773</link>
      <description>On August 22nd, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, expressed his views on the impact of Powell&apos;s interest rate policy on the crypto market during his appearance on the Crypto Banter podcast. The key points are as follows:1. He doesn&apos;t believe that Powell has to do anything. Personally, he won&apos;t trade based on the assumption that &quot;the Fed cuts rates by 50 basis points.&quot; If Powell insists on not cutting rates, the government will definitely find a way to &quot;squeeze out liquidity.&quot;2. The market is very likely to replay the 2022 scenario - anticipating a rate cut, but Powell suddenly delivers a &quot;hawkish blow,&quot; resulting in a market crash.3. If Powell delivers a hawkish speech at Jackson Hole, ETH may retest $4000 first.Regarding stablecoins, Arthur Hayes said that people&apos;s imagination about stablecoins is not big enough. Treasury Secretary Benson will use stablecoins to reverse the trend of &quot;de-dollarization&quot; - bringing back global offshore dollar flows to the United States whil</description>

      <title>Market Betting Powell to Stay Hawkish on Rate Cuts</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25772</link>
      <description>August 22nd. The data of currency options indicates that the bullish sentiment towards the US dollar has reached the highest level in three weeks. Traders are betting that Powell will not adopt an overly dovish stance on interest rate cuts. &quot;The possibility of a 25-basis-point rate cut in September will be maintained,&quot; said Sonja Martens, the director of FX and currency policy research at Deutsche Bank. &quot;But I don&apos;t think he will be more aggressive than that.&quot;Martens suggested that Powell may resist the pressure from Trump for rate cuts and will &quot;very clearly show that he will not take a path that may lack fundamental support due to the pressure from the White House.&quot; Nick Rees, the head of macro research at Monex Europe, said that if the market &quot;overreacts&quot; to any hints from Powell about a possible rate cut in September, it may trigger the initial selling of the US dollar. However, this situation may be temporary. &quot;Overall, we expect a hawkish tone, which will further strengthen the</description>

      <title>Analysis: Mixed Feelings Economic Data May Force Powell to Strike a Balance in Tonight&apos;s Speech</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25771</link>
      <description>August 22: Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is scheduled to deliver a speech at the Jackson Hole Annual Economic Symposium at 10 p.m. Beijing time on Friday. Currently, the Fed is encountering unprecedented political pressure from the United States. However, the mixed economic data may compel Powell to adopt a moderate stance, leaving key issues unresolved.Regarding the interest rate policy, some analysts anticipate a middle-of-the-road approach. Powell may potentially leave the door open for a rate cut in September to recognize the necessity for further easing due to weak job growth. Nevertheless, he will not make more definite commitments until policymakers are more certain that the rising inflation is temporary. This stance may not satisfy Trump, who advocates for a significant cut in rates to around 1%, nor investors who are betting on multiple rate cuts this year. Although the market&apos;s confidence in a September rate cut has already shown signs of wavering. (Golde</description>
