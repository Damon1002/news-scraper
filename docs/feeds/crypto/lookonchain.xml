      <title>WBTC Listed on Aptos Network</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21321</link>
      <description>On July 22nd, Aptos announced that LayerZero has launched a full-chain version of WBTC based on the OFT standard, presenting a new avenue for Bitcoin to cross-chain to Aptos. This version of WBTC can seamlessly traverse chains through LayerZero without the need for additional wrapping or delays.

These two types of assets together have removed barriers that have long hindered the on-chain potential of Bitcoin, achieving simplified transfer processes, unified liquidity, and directly connecting BTC to Aptos&apos;s high-performance DeFi ecosystem.Aptos has more than $430 million in BTC-backed assets, $1.35 billion in stablecoin liquidity, and has received support from mainstream protocols such as Aries, Echo, and Hyperion, making it one of the most promising and capit</description>
