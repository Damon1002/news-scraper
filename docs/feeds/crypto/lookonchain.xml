      <title>「Fed&apos;s Microphone」: Powell Refuses Predetermined Rate Cut Path</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22550</link>
      <description>On July 31st, &quot;Fed&apos;s Whisperer&quot; Nick Timiraos put up on social media that Fed Chair Powell has adopted a &quot;tough defense stance&quot; regarding whether to cut rates in September.When asked in a provocative manner &quot;What would lead to a rate cut in September?&quot;, Powell replied, &quot;I will not provide a specific answer. We need to observe the development of the data. There are multiple possibilities. We will make decisions based on comprehensive data analysis and a risk-balanced assessment.&quot;Just as the Potomac Research Group often states: If we are hungry, we will naturally eat.</description>

      <title>Analyst: Fed&apos;s Future Rate Cuts Pose a Significant Communication Challenge</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22546</link>
      <description>On July 31st, Tom Graff, the Chief Investment Officer of Facet Company, stated that the Federal Reserve is clearly in a rather delicate situation. Logically speaking, they had anticipated that the new tariffs would bring a certain level of inflation. Ideally, the Fed would prefer to wait until inflation reaches its peak before considering a rate cut. Nevertheless, the pressure is constantly building. Even if the White House is not applying external pressure, the recent weakness in the labor market is sufficient to cause concern for the Fed.In fact, this is likely the reason why Bullard and Bowman voted against maintaining the existing interest rate and advocated for a rate cut at this meeting. I believe that this decision has laid the groundwork for the Fed to initiate rate cuts at the September meeting and may implement 1 to 2 more rate cuts this year. The challenge lies in the fact that despite the potential for rising prices, the Fed still needs to cut rates. This will pose extrem</description>

      <title>Analyst: Powell&apos;s Statement Leans Toward Hawkish Stance</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22545</link>
      <description>On July 31st, analyst Chris Anstey declared that Powell mentioned, &quot;There remains a great deal and a great deal of uncertainty to navigate through. Indeed, we are constantly obtaining more data. However, it seems to be a distance away at present, the conclusion of that process. I believe there will be a lot of developments out there.&quot; This assertion leans towards a hawkish stance.The Federal Reserve Chair Powell also pointed out that it is not feasible to make a decision six weeks from now based on the June forecasts (dot plot). In his personal view, we are in a moderately restrictive range, but there is a range of opinions on this matter. (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>Economist: Federal Reserve&apos;s Statement Adjustment Surprisingly Reduces Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22544</link>
      <description>On July 31st, Kathy Bostjancic, the Chief Economist at American Life Insurance Company, declared that surprisingly, the Fed removed the previous language regarding the reduction of uncertainty in the economic outlook from the policy statement and instead focused on the fact that uncertainty remains &quot;still elevated.&quot;In our perspective, although uncertainty still exists, it has actually decreased significantly as the trade and tariff situation has become more clarified.

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22542</link>
      <description>On July 31st, Federal Reserve Chair Powell stated that the year-on-year June core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate might be 2.7%.
