      <title>EU Official: US 15% Tariff on EU is an All-In Tariff</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23221</link>
      <description>On Tuesday, EU officials stated that the 15% tariff imposed on EU goods entering the United States is comprehensive and covers the most favored nation rate. This is different from some other countries that have agreements with the US. The official pointed out that the 15% tariff applies to all goods except steel and aluminum. Currently, drugs and semiconductors have a zero tariff, but if these goods are subject to an increase due to the US 232 investigation, the tariff will also not exceed 15%. This 15% maximum also extends to cars and automotive parts. There are no quotas or restrictions on cars and automotive parts. (Golden Finance)</description>

      <title>The PROVE token has been deployed on the BSC and Ethereum mainnet</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23218</link>
      <description>August 5th. According to on-chain analyst Ai Auntie (@ai_9684xtpa), Binance HODLer&apos;s new coin, PROVE token, has been deployed on both the BSC and Ethereum mainnets. Specifically, 6 million tokens have been deployed on the BSC. The top first and second addresses hold 500,000 and 1 million PROVE tokens respectively. It is currently impossible to determine the exact amount of the Alpha airdrop. Looking at recent Alpha airdrops, the airdrop values of different projects vary greatly, ranging from as low as 1 million to as high as 8.68 million. If these 5 million PROVE tokens (or a portion of them) are used for the airdrop, then this will also be a large distribution. On the Ethereum mainnet, 1 billion tokens have been deployed, including 15 million tokens designated for the Binance HODLer airdrop. The airdrop claim time is currently uncertain.</description>

      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation volume will reach $944 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23216</link>
      <description>On August 5th, according to Coinglass data, in the event that Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the cumulative intensity of long liquidation on mainstream CEXs will reach $944 million.On the other hand, if Bitcoin rebounds above $115,000, the cumulative intensity of short liquidation on mainstream CEXs will reach $77.28 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, which is referred to as intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent reaching a certain price level will have an impact. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that once the price reaches that level, a more intense reaction will occur due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
