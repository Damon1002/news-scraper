      <title>Source: https://www.example.comInformant: Hong Kong Regulatory Authority Shows Low Acceptance of &quot;HK Stock Crypto Treasury&quot; Direction</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27640</link>
      <description>On September 4th, as reported by Caixin, Weng Xiaoqi, the CEO of NewFire Technology, stated that Digital Asset Treasuries (DAT), cryptocurrency ETFs, and traditional cryptocurrency exchanges all essentially offer entry points for funds to engage in cryptocurrency trading.

However, currently, the medium for cryptocurrency trading is evolving towards a more lightweight approach, and currently, DAT is the most lightweight way for traditional investors to enter the crypto world.An anonymous senior digital asset investor told Caixin that although the Hong Kong stock exchange is an option, after communicating with the Hong Kong regulatory authorities, it was discovered that Hong Kong has a relatively low level of acceptance for this direction, and market participants may still need to lobby local regulators.</description>
