      <title>Coinbase Sues German Man, Accusing Him of Maliciously Domain Hijacking and Extortion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22074</link>
      <description>On July 28th, Coinbase initiated a lawsuit against a German man named Tobias Honscha in the California federal court. It accused him of maliciously squatting the domain name coinbase.de and attempting to extort the company.Coinbase alleges that Honscha utilized the domain to redirect users to a physical coin trading app and made profits through the Coinbase affiliate marketing program, which violated the prohibition in the affiliate agreement against using the term &quot;Coinbase&quot; in a domain name.More importantly, Coinbase accuses Honscha of threatening that if the company did not purchase the domain at a high price, there might be a phishing attack, including risks such as &quot;unauthorized submission of identification documents, passwords, and one-time two-factor authentication codes.&quot; Coinbase deems this as &quot;clear extortion behavior.&quot;Coinbase is seeking a court order to halt the use of the domain, transfer domain ownership, and seek compensation for losses.

      <title>Decentralized Liquidity Platform Gyroscope&apos;s Dynamic Liquidity Pool is now live on Avalanche, releasing LP Yield Report</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22073</link>
      <description>On July 28th, Gyroscope released a report on Twitter, presenting the performance of LP Yield and Dynamic Liquidity Pool (Dynamic E-CLP) on the ETH/USDC trading pair on the Base chain. When measured by the Markouts metric, the pool&apos;s execution efficiency significantly surpassed that of mainstream DEXs. Specifically:- It outperformed Uniswap v2 by 3.5 times.- It outperformed Uniswap v3 by up to 33 times (based on total yield).Markouts are used to measure the transaction execution efficiency of liquidity pools. If assets are bought and sold at a price better than the market price, it is regarded as positive Markouts, indicating that LPs are actually earning spread income. This metric is independent of asset trends and can evaluate the quality of market-making strategies. Additionally, Gyroscope&apos;s Dynamic Liquidity Pool has now been deployed on Avalanche, initially supporting the AVAX/USDC and GYD trading pairs, and has initiated LP incentives with an APR of up to 107%.</description>
