      <title>Due to factors such as the shockingly low nonfarm payroll data in the US, the probability of a Fed rate cut in September surged to 80.3%.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22972</link>
      <description>On August 3rd, this week in the US, only 73,000 non-farm jobs were added in July, which was much lower than expected. The data for June and May were also revised downward significantly. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Board Member Cugler will resign next week, enabling Trump to appoint a preferred candidate earlier.Perhaps affected by the above news, on the CME &quot;FedWatch&quot; tool, the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September soared to 80.3%. Before the non-farm payroll data, this figure was only 41.3%.</description>

      <title>Elon Musk asked Grok about the probability of quantum computing breaking the Bitcoin algorithm (SHA-256), to which Grok replied, &quot;Almost 0 in the next 5 years.&quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22968</link>
      <description>August 3rd: According to the published article by IBM on the research progress of quantum computing, Musk inquired of Grok about the probability of quantum computing breaking the Bitcoin algorithm (SHA-256).Grok replied that, based on the investigations by NIST, IBM, and experts for 2025, the probability of quantum computing breaking SHA-256 is &quot;nearly 0% within the next 5 years and will be less than 10% by 2035.&quot; This requires millions of error-corrected quantum bits, while current systems only support about 1,000 noisy quantum bits. For now, Bitcoin&apos;s hash value remains secure.</description>
