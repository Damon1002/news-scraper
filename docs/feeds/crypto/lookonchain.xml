      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25524</link>
      <description>On August 21st, the latest market analysis report from glassnode indicated that there are signs of the exhaustion of Bitcoin&apos;s capital inflow. Even though the price reached a new high of $124,400, the demand is weakening. While this demand slowdown was occurring, speculative positions surged. The open interest in major altcoin futures contracts once reached a record high of $60 billion and then pulled back by $2.5 billion.Ethereum, which has long been considered a barometer of the &quot;altcoin season,&quot; has once again become the barometer of this round of volatility. Its hodler dominance has risen to the fourth-highest level in history, while the perpetual contract trading dominance has surged to a new high of 67%, marking the strongest structural shift to date.From a cyclical perspective, Bitcoin&apos;s price action also echoes previous patterns.

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25522</link>
      <description>August 21st. The North Wales Police are conducting an investigation into a significant cryptocurrency theft case. A fraudster posed as a senior UK police officer and managed to steal ï¿¡2.1 million (approximately $2.8 million) worth of Bitcoin.The police declared that this was a &quot;highly targeted and sophisticated fraud.&quot; The fraudster might have acquired victim information through a data breach. The fraudster claimed to have arrested a suspect in possession of the victim&apos;s identification and used this to generate panic and a sense of urgency. The victim, believing they were following police instructions, logged into a cold wallet via a link provided by the fraudster. Believing they were on a legitimate website, the victim entered their recovery phrase on a carefully fabricated fake website, resulting in the theft of funds. (Cointelegraph)</description>

      <title>Goldman Sachs: The Current Market Is Experiencing the Beginning of a Stablecoin &apos;Gold Rush&apos;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25518</link>
      <description>August 21st. A research report issued by Will Nance and others from Goldman Sachs Bank indicated that the current market is at the outset of a stablecoin &quot;gold rush.&quot;The report stated: &quot;Stablecoins represent a global market worth $2.71 trillion. We think that USDC will gain from the growth of its market share both within and outside Binance&apos;s platform. As the ongoing stablecoin legislation legitimizes the ecosystem and as the crypto ecosystem expands, which may also be triggered by legislation. Based on current trends and announced initiatives, USDC is anticipated to grow by $770 billion from 2024 to 2027, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40%.&quot;The bank concluded, &quot;Therefore, in the long term, the payment sector is the most evident source of stablecoin expansion. This opportunity has hardly been tapped so far, with most stablecoin activities being driven by cryptocurrency trading and non-US dollar demands outside the US.&quot; (Jinse)</description>
