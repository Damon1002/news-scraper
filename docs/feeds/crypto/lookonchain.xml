      <title>Federal Reserve Meeting Minutes: Tariffs on Goods Prices Pose Upward Inflationary Pressure</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25438</link>
      <description>August 21st: The Federal Reserve disclosed the minutes of the July meeting. It was noted that the actual GDP growth in the first half of the year was moderate. The unemployment rate has been continuously low, and consumer price inflation remains relatively high. The slowdown in inflation appears to have come to a halt, with tariffs exerting upward pressure on goods price inflation.After net exports significantly pulled down GDP growth in the first quarter, their contribution turned significantly positive in the second quarter. The actual import of goods and services decreased substantially. This may be due to a large amount of early imports in response to the anticipated tariff increase in the first quarter. In contrast, the decline in goods exports was relatively mild, while service exports continued to increase. (FX168)</description>

      <title>Fed Meeting Minutes: Market Believes U.S. Economy Still Resilient</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25433</link>
      <description>August 21st: The minutes of the Federal Reserve&apos;s July meeting were released. It was mentioned that the recent stock price hikes and the narrowing of credit spreads suggest that the market believes the overall U.S. economy remains strong. Nevertheless, the financial markets seem to have begun to distinguish among firms based on the scale and quality of their earnings.The valuation of the S&amp;P 500 index remains above its long-term average level mainly because the market is optimistically expecting that large technology companies may gain potential benefits from the further application of artificial intelligence (AI). However, although the valuation of the small-cap stock index has increased during the intermeeting period, it is still below the historical average level. (FXStreet)</description>
