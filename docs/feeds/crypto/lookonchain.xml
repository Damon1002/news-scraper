      <title>Eugene &quot;Pump Signal&quot; NFT, this collection&apos;s performance will outpace that of the &quot;ETH Beta&quot; coin.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23873</link>
      <description>August 10th, Trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio took to his personal channel and said, &quot;The so-called &apos;Leveraged ETH Beta&apos; concept keeps coming up in the minds of speculators as long as the underlying asset is in a trend. At different times, the market will favor different names (assets). But all these names have the same shortcoming - their &apos;Beta&apos; performance is not satisfactory.&quot;The definition of Beta indicates that as the price of the underlying asset fluctuates, the volatility of the Beta asset should be greater than that of the underlying asset (correlation &gt; 1). For all other altcoins, this means that funds need to flow from ETH to the altcoin. In the past, when there were limited optional assets, this logic worked. But in today&apos;s market, with a large number of projects vying to become the &apos;preferred ETH Beta,&apos; people easily get confused.However, there is still a relatively low-profile type of asset, which is NFTs. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that their price is denominated in ETH</description>
