      <title>Powell to Speak at Jackson Hole Symposium on August 22, Market Focused on Rate Cut Expectations and Successor Selection</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24663</link>
      <description>August 15th. As per the schedule of the Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is set to deliver a speech on the economic outlook and the evaluation of the Fed&apos;s policy framework at the annual central bank symposium of the Kansas City Fed in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on August 22nd at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (10 p.m. Beijing Time). This speech arrives at a crucial time: recent data indicates that tariff measures have had a partial impact on inflation, and the labor market is showing a slowdown. This complex situation reinforces the market&apos;s anticipation that the Fed may announce a 25-basis-point rate cut at the next month&apos;s meeting. Meanwhile, U.S. President Trump continuously exerts pressure for a rate cut and is searching for potential replacements. Powell&apos;s term as Fed Chair will come to an end in May of next year.

      <title>CNBC: Potential Fed Chair David Zervos Supports Significant Rate Cut</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24660</link>
      <description>On August 15th, as reported by CNBC, David Zervos, the Chief Market Strategist at JPMorgan and a potential Fed chair, stated that Federal Reserve officials should not be frightened by the higher-than-expected potential inflationary pressures indicated by the July Producer Price Index. Instead, he argued that the Fed should take proactive accommodative measures at present to prevent a slowdown in the labor market, which would effectively help create more than 1 million jobs.Over the past three Fed meetings, Zervos has continuously advocated for a 0.5 percentage point cut in the federal funds rate, and he reiterated this stance in the interview. &quot;I definitely still hold the same view. I think there is a very reasonable and compelling narrative that indicates monetary policy is restrictive. Overall, I don&apos;t see any reason to change that view.&quot;</description>

      <title>Fed&apos;s Powell: 4.2% Unemployment Rate Is Not a Bad Number</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24655</link>
      <description>On August 15th, Federal Reserve&apos;s Bostic remarked that a 4.2% unemployment rate is not a negative figure. The unemployment rate has remained very steady, with the deceleration of job growth aligning with the slowdown in labor force growth.The initial employment data is more astonishing compared to the revised data. Businesses have been curbing their hiring, so even in the face of cost pressures, there may not be much scope for layoffs. Given wage growth and employment, the underlying momentum of households still appears to be robust. (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>Inflation Leading Indicator &quot;Goes Through the Roof,&quot; Fed Rate Cut Prospects Face Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24654</link>
      <description>On Thursday, August 15th, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released a report. It showed that wholesale prices rose significantly more than expected in July, driven by a surge in profit margins. This may indicate that inflation still poses a threat to the U.S. economy. Service inflation was a key factor in the overall increase in the Producer Price Index (PPI). Service prices rose by 1.1% in July, which was also the largest increase since March 2022.The report indicated that although there was weak demand in the first half of this year, businesses are adjusting the pricing of goods and services to help offset the costs associated with U.S. tariff increases. How much of the tariff costs businesses pass on to consumers will be a key factor in shaping future interest rate trends.Due to Trump&apos;s policies, especially the economic uncertainty brought about by tariff policies, businesses have reduced the number of new hires.
