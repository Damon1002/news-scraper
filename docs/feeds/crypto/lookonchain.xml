      <title>Viewpoint: Multiple Bitcoin Technical Indicators Suggest Short-Term Top Is In</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26857</link>
      <description>On August 29th, according to analyst @ali_charts, several Bitcoin technical indicators suggest that a short-term top is approaching:1. RSI Divergence: Although the price keeps reaching new highs, the RSI continues to hit new lows. This divergence is similar to the trend from April to November 2021, indicating the end of this cycle.2. Bearish MACD Cross: This week, the MACD has turned bearish, coinciding with the price drop and increasing the downside risk.3. MVRV Momentum: The Bitcoin MVRV momentum indicator has recently witnessed a &quot;death cross,&quot; suggesting that the macro momentum will change from positive to negative. Historically, this has been a reliable signal of a cyclical top.Key Support Levels: The current significant level to monitor is $108,700. If the weekly closing price drops below this level, it will confirm a deeper trend shift. Further down, there is the initial on-chain accumulation support at $104,500. There is also a major historical demand zone at $97,000. A</description>

      <title>Bitunix Analyst: PCE Forward Guidance Points to Third Consecutive Hike, September Rate Cut Sentiment Unchanged; BTC Faces Resistance at 114600, Support at 107600 Likely to be Tested</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26855</link>
      <description>August 29th: The market anticipates that the core PCE will grow by 0.3% in July, with a year-on-year growth reaching 2.9% to 3.0%, marking the third consecutive increase. Tariff transmission has driven up inflation. However, Powell has alleviated inflation concerns at the Jackson Hole Symposium and shifted the focus to employment. This indicates that the probability of a &quot;insurance rate cut&quot; in September remains high. Nevertheless, if the PCE shows signs of overheating, the number and pace of future rate cuts for the rest of the year may be restricted. The consumer side may have reached its peak, with a focus on wages and core services.On the crypto market front, the BTC liquidation heat map shows a concentration of liquidations around 114,000, with further support at 116,800; the downside support is observed at 107,600.Advice from Bitunix analysts:This round of PCE data will have a greater impact on the subsequent easing pace rather than the September decision itself.

      <title>XPL &quot;Price Manipulator&quot; or Top Individual Holder of WLFI Token</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26853</link>
      <description>On August 29th, according to on-chain analyst Ai姨 (@ai_9684xtpa), the WLFI TOP1 holding address, moonmanifest.eth, was identified by Arkham today as belonging to TechnoRevenant (XPL &quot;Price Manipulator&quot;). This address had made an investment of $15 million (13 million USDC + 2.01 million USDT) during the first public sale round seven months ago and currently holds 1 billion WLFI tokens, accounting for 1.0007% of the total supply.It is crucial to note that this address is marked on Debank as belonging to the X account @moonmanifest47. There is a discrepancy in the platform tags. However, after cross-validation by Nansen, Ai姨 is of the opinion that the probability of it belonging to TechnoRevenant is relatively higher.</description>

      <title>Announcement: U.S. Core PCE Price Index YoY for July and U.S. University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index Final Value for August will be released tonight</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26850</link>
      <description>On August 29th, based on the schedule, the US July Core PCE Price Index Annual Rate will be released at 20:30 Beijing time tonight. Meanwhile, the final value of the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index for August will be announced at 22:00.According to forecasts, the PCE Price Index is anticipated to rise by 0.3% in July, remaining the same as the previous month. If this forecast comes true, the year-on-year growth rate of PCE inflation will go up from 2.8% to 2.9%, reaching the highest level since February this year and also being the third consecutive month of increase.Economists state that high inflation may restrict the space for further rate cuts later this year. Some believe that only a significant increase in the August CPI inflation data, which will be released in two weeks, can prompt the Fed to reexamine its rate cut plans during the meeting on September 16th to 17th.
