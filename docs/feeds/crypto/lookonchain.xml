      <title>Analysis: Powell has clearly stated that the Fed&apos;s primary goal has shifted to supporting the labor market, and interest rate decisions will be guided by employment data</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25825</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, based on The Kobeissi Letter&apos;s analysis, the significance of Fed Chair Powell&apos;s speech today is as follows: &quot;Today&apos;s speech shows that their (the Fed&apos;s) primary attention has now turned to propping up the labor market. A change in the risk balance may necessitate policy adjustments, and he specifically mentioned the labor market.&quot;Consequently, the employment report will decide future rate cuts.</description>

      <title>Bloomberg Economist: Powell&apos;s remarks today were not dovish; he was merely &quot;walking a tightrope&quot; between political pressure and hawkishness</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25824</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, Bloomberg economist Anna Wong offered comments on Powell&apos;s remarks, saying, &quot;Powell&apos;s statements today are not in a dovish stance. Over the course of time, people will come to understand just how tough this rhetoric is. The market&apos;s instinctive reaction is reversed later on; this has happened before.&quot;Today, he skillfully demonstrated how to &quot;walk a tightrope&quot;: soothing political pressure (by providing just enough indications of a rate cut to allow everyone to interpret it in their own way), laying the groundwork for a hawkish response, while at the same time maintaining a low profile.</description>

      <title>Canada to Lift Retaliatory Tariffs on the U.S., Extending an Olive Branch to Trump</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25822</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, Canada is going to lift the retaliatory tariffs on a large number of American products that meet the existing North American Free Trade Agreement. This is intended to ease tensions with the White House. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is expected to make this announcement on Friday after a cabinet meeting. According to sources familiar with the matter and requesting anonymity, the government will adjust its tariff policy to be more in line with the United States&apos; measures.This indicates that many American consumer goods will no longer be subject to a 25% tariff when exported to Canada as long as they comply with the terms of the USMCA. However, the Canadian government may keep a 25% import tariff on American steel and aluminum products, as well as tariffs on American automobiles. Former President Trump had imposed tariffs on these industries. (Soochow Securities)</description>

      <title>Jump Crypto has proposed the DFBA mechanism to address the challenges of traditional CLOBs on the blockchain.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25818</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, the research team of market maker Jump Crypto published an article putting forward a new trading mechanism named Dual Flow Batch Auction (DFBA), with the aim of addressing the challenges faced by traditional Continuous Limit Order Books (CLOBs) on the blockchain.It is reported that CLOBs rely on continuous matching and a time priority mechanism, which gives rise to latency arbitrage, MEV (Miner Extractable Value) issues, and adverse trading liquidity, thereby increasing market trading costs.DFBA conducts two independent auctions every 100 milliseconds. It divides orders into Maker and Taker groups and completes transactions at a single fair settlement price. This mechanism eliminates the time priority, avoids competition among liquidity providers, and shifts the competitive focus from speed to price and scale.Compared to traditional designs, DFBA can provide tighter quotes, deeper liquidity. At the same time, it protects natural traders from the impacts of latency</description>
