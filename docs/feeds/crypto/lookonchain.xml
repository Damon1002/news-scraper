      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27432</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have just put forth a joint statement. It is clearly stated that exchanges registered with the SEC and CFTC are not banned from providing trading services for certain spot crypto asset products.SEC Chairman Paul Atkins remarked, &quot;Market participants should have the freedom to decide where to trade spot crypto assets.&quot;CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham said, &quot;During the previous administration, our agencies sent inconsistent signals regarding the regulation and compliance issues in the digital asset market. However, the message conveyed was very distinct: innovation was not welcomed. That era has come to an end.&quot;This move represents an important step for the &quot;Crypto Project&quot; and &quot;Crypto Sprint&quot; initiatives of the two agencies. The purpose is to coordinate regulation while expanding trading venue options and flexibility for U.S. market participants.</description>

      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4200, the cumulative long liquidation strength of major CEXs will reach $1.53 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27425</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, the cryptocurrency market remains on a downward trajectory. According to Coinglass data, in the event that Ethereum drops below $4200, the cumulative intensity of long liquidation in mainstream CEXs will reach $1.553 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum surges above $4400, the cumulative intensity of short liquidation in mainstream CEXs will reach $0.940 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not precisely depict the number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent clusters, that is, intensity. Consequently, the liquidation chart showcases the degree to which the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it attains a certain level. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that when the price reaches that level, it will experience a more pronounced reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
