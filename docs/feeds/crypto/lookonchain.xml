      <title>Around $33 billion worth of ETH is currently queued to exit the Ethereum PoS network, while around $10.3 billion worth of ETH is waiting to join.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24578</link>
      <description>On August 14th, based on the data from the Validator Queue tracking website ValidatorQueue, the current exit queue of the Ethereum PoS network is temporarily reported to be 702,703 ETH, which is approximately worth 3.3 billion US dollars. The amount of queued ETH has been increasing continuously for 3 days. The recent peak reached 744,000 ETH, and the waiting time for exiting is approximately 12 days and 5 hours.At the same time, about 220,266 ETH are queued to join the network, with a value of approximately 1.03 billion US dollars. The expected activation delay is about 3 days and 20 hours.Previously reported, this situation reflects the existence of two opposing forces in the market. On the one hand, some stakers may choose to cash out after Ethereum rebounded by more than 160% from its April low, resulting in a surge in the exit queue. On the other hand, new funds deposited due to regulatory optimism and institutional demand are also driving up the entry queue. Listed companies</description>

      <description>August 14th. According to Fortune magazine, Binance co-founder He Yi holds around 10% of Binance&apos;s shares.

      <title>Analyst: BTC Volatility Hits New Two-Year Low, Signaling Potential Imminent Spike</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24574</link>
      <description>On August 14th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. put forward that, &quot;Based on the 30-day high-low price indicator, the volatility of Bitcoin has been compressed to the lowest level in two years: the range between the highest and lowest prices within the past 30 days has become narrower, and the range formed by the rolling high/low prices has constricted the price within it. This compression typically indicates a balance between supply and demand and low realized volatility. When liquidity is concentrated at local highs (above $120,000) and lows (below $113,000), such a situation emerges. The possibility of the expansion of the price range is on the rise.&quot;</description>
