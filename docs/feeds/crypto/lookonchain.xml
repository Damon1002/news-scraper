      <title>Federal Reserve Chair to Deliver Speech on the 22nd, Market Focused on Rate Cut Expectations and Succession Plan Issues</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24697</link>
      <description>August 15th. Based on the schedule of the Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is scheduled to deliver a speech on the economic outlook and the evaluation of the Federal Reserve&apos;s policy framework at the annual central bank meeting of the Kansas City Fed in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on August 22nd at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (10 p.m. Beijing Time).This speech arrives at a crucial time: recent data indicates that tariff measures have had a certain impact on inflation, while the labor market is showing a slowdown. This complex situation has enhanced the market&apos;s expectation that the Federal Reserve may announce a 25-basis-point rate cut at the next month&apos;s meeting. Meanwhile, U.S. President Trump continues to put pressure for a rate cut and is seeking a replacement. Powell&apos;s term as Federal Reserve Chairman will expire in May next year.
