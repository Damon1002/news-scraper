      <title>《Stablecoin Regulation》 Takes Effect, Some Hong Kong Money Changers Still Exchange USDT Without License</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23797</link>
      <description>August 9th. According to Caixin, the Hong Kong &quot;Stablecoin Regulation&quot; came into effect on August 1, 2025. In addition to establishing an issuer licensing system, the regulation clearly states that without being a &quot;permitted offeror&quot; holding one of the five types of licenses, one is not allowed to conduct stablecoin &quot;offerings&quot; in Hong Kong. In other words, exchanges that previously operated USDT and USDC stablecoin exchange businesses in Hong Kong will need to suspend such operations.Reporters discovered that some exchanges, represented by &quot;One Bitcoin&quot; and &quot;5X Crypto&quot;, have suspended the exchange of USDT, USDC, and fiat currency. Some exchanges like &quot;BitsMark&quot; have even ceased operations. However, exchanges such as &quot;Crypto Panda&quot; and &quot;Star Coin&quot; still facilitate private inquiry transactions while no longer displaying prices for exchanging stablecoins to users.</description>
