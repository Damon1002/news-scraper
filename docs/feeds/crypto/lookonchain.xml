      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin&apos;s Near-Term Outlook May Depend on US Economic Data</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26106</link>
      <description>On August 25th, Linh Tran, a market analyst at XS.com, stated that the recent outlook for Bitcoin will mainly depend on the upcoming U.S. economic data, such as preliminary GDP and core personal consumption expenditures inflation. If the data continues to indicate a slowing U.S. economy and easing inflation, the Federal Reserve will have more grounds to initiate a rate-cutting cycle.Tran said, &quot;This situation will create a liquidity-rich environment that is conducive to Bitcoin&apos;s recovery.&quot; However, Tran also added that if the data unexpectedly turns out to be &quot;hot,&quot; investors may adopt a defensive stance and extend the short-term pullback.

      <title>CZ Reminder: Taking a photo with a community member does not equate to endorsement, and engaging with likes and retweets on Twitter does not necessarily indicate approval or support for a project</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26101</link>
      <description>August 25th. Binance&apos;s founder CZ posted on social media to give a reminder. &quot;In the past few days, I have taken hundreds of selfies with everyone. After a speech, I usually spend some time taking group photos with them. With proper organization, we can take 600 selfies in 30 minutes, which is about 3 seconds per photo.&quot;During this time, some people try to talk to me or sell me something, but that is not the right moment. Smart people leave a business card with a brief sentence introduction. (My favorite is the one with a Signal or WhatsApp QR code.) Besides that, I cannot and will not accept any other papers or gifts.Taking a photo with me does not imply any endorsement. I usually have no idea what projects everyone is working on. When I interact with or like a photo on X, it is just because I like that photo. This also does not imply any endorsement or support for the project.</description>

      <title>If Bitcoin breaks $115,000, the mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation intensity will reach $1.049 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26100</link>
      <description>On August 25th, according to Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $115,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $1.049 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $112,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $209 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to the adjacent liquidation cluster, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the price of the underlying asset will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will undergo a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade when it reaches that level.</description>
