      <title>VanEck CEO: Ethereum is the &quot;Wall Street Token,&quot; Stablecoin Growth Drives Traditional Financial Institutions&apos; Demand for Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26608</link>
      <description>On August 28th, Jan F. van Eck, the CEO and president of VanEck, stated in an interview with FOX News that Ethereum is what I refer to as a &quot;Wall Street Token.&quot; With the emergence of stablecoins, every bank - in fact, every financial services firm - must find a way to accept stablecoins. If I want to send you a stablecoin, your bank has to figure it out; otherwise, you will go to another institution that can handle it. &quot;The people on Wall Street will eventually turn around and ask: What exactly is this thing? On which chain should I develop? The answer is Ethereum.&quot;Jan F. van Eck also stated that Ethereum was indeed despised by many earlier this year at its low point for various reasons. VanEck actually has a list of &quot;actively managed ETFs.&quot;</description>

      <title>Former US Treasury Secretary Yellen: Firing Cook is illegal and dangerous, US credibility is at risk</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26605</link>
      <description>August 28th: In reaction to the controversy that was triggered by Trump&apos;s dismissal of Federal Reserve Board Governor Powell, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen stated: Trump claims to have &quot;fired&quot; Powell with &quot;valid reasons.&quot; This action is not only illegal but also extremely perilous.This is a blatant attempt to politicize the Federal Reserve. It is a threat to its leadership and an attempt to make monetary policy bow to the will of the president. Such an action could lead to the end of the Fed&apos;s independenceâ€”and what will follow is the collapse of the credibility of U.S. monetary policy at home and abroad.Yellen calls on Congress to safeguard the Fed&apos;s independence. The courts must reject this illegal abuse of power. The financial industry should also voice its opposition to this direct attack on the credibility of the dollar. (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>Analyst: Linea team-associated address deployed or used for airdrop multiplier calculation smart contract</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26602</link>
      <description>August 28th. On-chain analyst Zack stated in a post that an address linked to the Linea team has a source of funds that can be traced. This address has deployed the &quot;Linea Allocation Multiplier&quot; contract on the Linea mainnet. It is possible that this contract is used for airdrop multiplier calculation. The same address had previously released the &quot;Spin to Win&quot; game to test the Linea Hub.Zach further noted that since the main criteria for Linea&apos;s airdrop will be points (LXP) and on-chain multipliers, and both are now in place, it may suggest that Linea will soon begin accepting airdrop inquiries.At the same time, Zach cautioned users that the authenticity of the contract has not been verified and advised users not to interact with it.</description>
