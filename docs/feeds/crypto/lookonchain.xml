      <title>JPMorgan: Bitcoin Volatility Hits Historic Low, Price Undervalued Compared to Gold</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26724</link>
      <description>August 28th - According to Coindesk, JPMorgan Chase stated in a research report that Bitcoin is considered to be too inexpensive when compared to gold because its volatility has reached a historical low. The report pointed out that Bitcoin&apos;s six-month rolling volatility has decreased from nearly 60% at the start of the year to approximately 30% currently, which constitutes a new low. With volatility approaching that of gold, Bitcoin&apos;s current volatility is only twice that of gold, also representing the lowest ratio in history. JPMorgan Chase believes that this makes Bitcoin increasingly appealing to institutional portfolios.Based on volatility-adjusted calculations, Bitcoin&apos;s market capitalization would need to increase by 13%, with a price of around $126,000, in order to be in line with gold&apos;s $5 trillion private investment scale. According to the bank&apos;s model, Bitcoin is currently undervalued by approximately $16,000 compared to gold, indicating potential upward movement.</description>

This was because the strong U.S. economic growth and employment data somewhat weakened the market&apos;s perception that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates twice by the end of the year. The U.S. second-quarter economic growth rate was revised from 3% to 3.3%, surpassing the expectations of economists. After the release of this data, the yields on two to five-year U.S. Treasury bonds increased by at least two basis points to reach a daily high. Meanwhile, the initial jobless claims experienced a greater-than-expected decline, which is a significant signal for the labor market.Sudra Rajappa, the U.S. Rate Strategist at Natixis, stated, &quot;The data continues to indicate that despite trade uncertainties, consumers still maintain resilience.&quot; Rajappa pointed out that the front end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve is experiencing a &quot;tug-of-war&quot; regarding whether the Fed should cut rates in Sep</description>
