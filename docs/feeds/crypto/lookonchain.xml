      <title>Goldman Sachs: Expects Trump Administration&apos;s Base Tariff Rate to Increase to 15%</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21475</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, David Mericle, the chief US economist at Goldman Sachs, anticipates that the US base &quot;parity&quot; tariff rate will be raised from 10% to 15%, with copper and key mineral tariffs reaching 50%. This move is likely to intensify inflationary pressures and dampen economic growth. In order to reflect the new tariff assumptions and incorporate the &quot;preliminary view&quot; of the impact of import tariffs, Goldman Sachs has simultaneously adjusted its forecasts for US inflation and GDP growth. Goldman Sachs has reduced its 2025 core inflation forecast from 3.4% to 3.3%, raised its 2026 forecast from 2.6% to 2.7%, and raised its 2027 forecast from 2.0% to 2.4%.Mericle stated that the tariffs are expected to push up core prices by 1.7% cumulatively over 2-3 years. He added that the tariffs will reduce this year&apos;s GDP growth rate by 1 percentage point, by 0.4 percentage point in 2026, and by 0.3 percentage point in 2027. As a result, Goldman Sachs has downgraded its 2025 GDP growth forecast</description>
