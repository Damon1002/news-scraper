      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23347</link>

Investigation of Chaos in Virtual Asset Investment.&quot; The report pointed out that through journalists&apos; investigations, it was found that there are currently some virtual asset investment platforms active in the market with keywords such as decentralization, blockchain, and virtual assets. They package their projects with terms like blockchain technology, smart contracts, DeFi, and Defai (DeFi + AI).Many illegal projects are packaged with concepts such as &quot;DeFi Decentralized Finance,&quot; &quot;DApp Financial Management,&quot; and &quot;Stablecoin Mining,&quot; but in essence, they are still fundraising and rebate activities, merely using technological shells to cover up risks.From a legal perspective, investors need to bear responsibility for their own civil legal actions.

      <title>Due to the recent market correction, analysts are divided on whether the altcoin season is coming.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23342</link>
      <description>August 6th: Following Bitcoin&apos;s recent drop to $112,000, altcoins failed to make a comeback. This has led analysts to hold diverse views on whether the altcoin season is approaching.A Bitfinex analyst stated in the Tuesday market report: &quot;Interestingly, the breakout in major coins did not translate into sustained buying in altcoins. On the contrary, the decline in altcoins and Bitcoin&apos;s weakness suggest that speculative interest is fading across the board. Thus, the market may be entering a consolidation phase. However, new macro events or strong inflows into cryptocurrency ETFs could quickly alter this situation.&quot;Cryptocurrency analyst Ted, on the other hand, said on Tuesday: &quot;This is the best opportunity to accumulate them before practical altcoins start their parabolic rises.&quot; (Contelegraph)</description>
