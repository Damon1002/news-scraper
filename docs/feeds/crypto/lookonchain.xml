      <title>Vitalik: Excited about an open-source AI model with contextual weighting and real-time editing capabilities, looking forward to brain-machine interface collaborations.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24043</link>
      <description>August 11th, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin shared in a post, saying, &quot;At present, many artificial intelligence developments are aiming to make systems as &apos;autonomous&apos; as they can be. However, in reality, creating more channels for human participation not only leads to better results (and this is likely to remain the case for a long time in the future), but is also more beneficial for security.&quot;&quot;Today, I am much more inclined towards AI models that are open-source weighted and have good &apos;editing&apos; capabilities rather than models that are simply created from scratch.&quot;&quot;In the medium term, I hope for a certain kind of advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that can provide me with real-time feedback while generating content and detect my sentiments towards each part, and then make adjustments based on the feedback.&quot;</description>

The team led by Scott Chronert increased the year-end target for the index from 6300 points to 6600 points, suggesting a roughly 3% growth compared to the close of last Friday.This quarter&apos;s earnings reports were stronger than expected, with little indication of the impact of tariffs on performance, which has driven the stock market to new highs this month. Institutional data shows that more than 81% of S&amp;P 500 index component companies have exceeded expectations, which is the highest level in seven quarters. The Citigroup team stated that companies not only performed well but also mostly maintained their expectations for the second half of the year.Therefore, market consensus earnings per share expectations are being elevated.

      <description>On August 11th, as per the latest weekly report from CoinShares, digital asset investment products witnessed inflows during the previous week, reaching a total of $572 million. Earlier this week, there were outflows of $1 billion, which might have been driven by growth concerns following the soft US employment data.However, in the latter part of the week, inflows reached $1.57 billion, possibly due to the US government&apos;s announcement permitting the use of digital assets in 401(k) retirement plans. The trading volume for digital asset ETPs decreased by 23% compared to the previous week, probably because of the subdued summer trading activity. Regionally, inflows in the US and Canada were $608 million and $16.5 million respectively, while Europe continued to experience outflows, with Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland having a total of $54.3 million in outflows.Ethereum ETP took the lead in the market, attracting $268 million in inflows and becoming the highest among all assets.
