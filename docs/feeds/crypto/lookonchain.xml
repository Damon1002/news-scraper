      <title>If Bitcoin breaks $114,000, the mainstream CEX&apos;s total short liquidation volume will reach $1.289 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27593</link>
      <description>On September 4th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $114,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will reach $1.289 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $111,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will reach $1.231 billion.**BlockBeats Note**: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to the adjacent cluster, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the underlying asset price will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will undergo a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade once it reaches that level.</description>
