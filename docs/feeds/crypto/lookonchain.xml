      <title>Bitunix Analyst: VINE Rebounds by 12.2% but Faces Continued Pressure, Short-term Focus on 0.082 and 0.094, Beware of Whale Sell Pressure and Speculative Fund Withdrawal Risk</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23039</link>
      <description>August 4th: The meme coin VINE has witnessed a 12.2% increase in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.07446. The trading volume has surged to 214 million, representing an increase of over 80%. The liquidation heat map indicates that the price received strong support in the range of 0.059 to 0.062 and experienced short liquidation, which triggered a technical rebound. However, significant liquidation pressure is evident in the range of 0.082 to 0.094, presenting an opportunity for short-term profit-taking.Since Elon Musk&apos;s tweet on July 24th promoting the AI revival Vine, VINE briefly soared to $0.172. However, without substantial follow-up news, profit-taking pressure ensued, and the price broke below the 30-day moving average. According to on-chain data, the top ten wallets still hold 40% of the supply, leaving the market liquidity risk unresolved. Additionally, the outflow of funds from the Solana network has further dampened the basic confidence.Bitunix Analyst Sugge</description>
