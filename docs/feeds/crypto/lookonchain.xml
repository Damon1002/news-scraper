      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Price Drops Below Short-Term HODLers&apos; Average Price, Causing Market Panic, Whales Still Accumulating During the Dip</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26946</link>
      <description>August 30th. On-chain data analyst Murphy posted on social media, indicating that when the Bitcoin price dropped below the short-term holder&apos;s average price of $108,000, the short-term sentiment changed from being anxious to being panicked. Currently, it is the weekend with low liquidity, which makes it likely to experience larger fluctuations.For investors who are still bullish on the overall BTC trend, there has been no pause in their accumulation during the pullback. The BTC balance on the Kraken exchange decreased significantly by 41,512 BTC in the two days from August 27th to August 29th. Based on previous chain analysis, Kraken&apos;s address is closely related to some treasury companies, traditional institutions, and OTC platforms.</description>

      <title>Trader Eugene: Currently not actively trading in the market, Bitcoin&apos;s breakout to the upside is a necessary condition for altcoin season.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26940</link>
      <description>August 30th: Trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio put up a post on his personal channel, indicating that he is not currently involved in market trading at present. Nevertheless, he needs to make it clear to his followers that if they want to witness a significant fluctuation in altcoins, they must rely on Bitcoin to boost the market. However, currently, the performance of Bitcoin has not lived up to the bullish expectations.Before this, on August 14th, Eugene said that he had already closed the majority of his ETH positions in order to significantly reduce the risk exposure as multiple warning signals were blinking before his eyes. On August 24th, he expressed his view that the bull market cycle is coming to an end, and his personal ETH trading has completely stopped.</description>
