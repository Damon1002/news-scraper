      <title>Trump Signs Executive Order to Adjust Tariff Policy Scope</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27929</link>
      <description>On September 6th, according to a statement from the White House, US President Trump signed an executive order to adjust the scope of import tariffs and implement trade and security framework agreements with foreign trading partners. The executive order stipulates that after reaching a framework agreement or a final agreement with foreign trading partners, the US may adjust tariffs in accordance with the agreement. This includes reducing equivalent tariffs to zero for some goods. However, the tariff scope is generally not narrowed or the Section 232 tariffs (steel and aluminum derivative tariffs) modified before the signing of the final agreement. Goods eligible for zero equivalent tariffs include products that cannot be produced in the US or are produced in insufficient quantities to meet domestic demand, specific agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented items for pharmaceutical applications.
