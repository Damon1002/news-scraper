      <title>Next week will see a dense release of macroeconomic data, and the market still expects the Federal Reserve to once again stand pat.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21978</link>
      <description>On July 27th: Against the complex backdrop of escalating political pressure, the continuous evolution of trade policies, and conflicting economic signals, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell and his colleagues will enter the interest rate decision meeting in the coming week. This decision coincides with a rare data-intensive week - the U.S. government will consecutively release GDP, jobs reports, and the Fed&apos;s core inflation indicator. While the market generally anticipates that the Fed will once again maintain stability, this series of data may reshape the policy path. Economists predict that the U.S. second-quarter GDP annualized growth rate, which will be released on Wednesday of next week, is expected to reach 2.4% (a significant improvement compared to the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter), but this is mainly due to a substantial narrowing of the trade deficit. The July non-farm payroll report, which will be released on Friday, is expected to confirm a cautious trend in business</description>

      <title>Analysis: The era of Parabolic Bull Market and Devastating Bear Market is over, Bitcoin&apos;s future will see continued consolidation, volatility, and upward movement.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21974</link>
      <description>July 27th. Mitchell Askew, a Blockware BTC analyst, stated that Bitcoin will no longer witness a &quot;parabolic&quot; price surge or a &quot;devastating&quot; bear market. The presence of a spot ETF has permanently reduced volatility and changed market dynamics. Bitcoin seemed to be two entirely different assets before and after the ETF launch. It is expected to reach $1 million in the next 10 years through continuous oscillation between &quot;upsurge&quot; and &quot;consolidation&quot;. This path will be boring for everyone and will drive out short-term speculators. A chart shared by Mitchell Askew shows that Bitcoin&apos;s price volatility has decreased significantly since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF in the United States in January 2024.Bloomberg&apos;s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas had previously stated that the reduction in volatility helps Bitcoin attract larger investors and provides a first-line opportunity for its adoption as a currency. However, the cost may be the potential absence of &quot;god-tier candlesticks&quot;. The sp</description>

      <title>TRM Labs: Russian Entity Allegedly Using Kyrgyzstan Cryptocurrency Platform to Evade Sanctions</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21972</link>
      <description>On July 27th, as per Decrypt, a report issued by the blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs indicates that Russian entities are leveraging a Kyrgyzstan cryptocurrency platform to evade sanctions. Cryptocurrency transactions related to Russia almost entirely dominate the Kyrgyzstan cryptocurrency industry, which was &quot;practically non-existent&quot; prior to the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict.On-chain analysis reveals that the now-defunct Russian exchange Garantex has likely rebranded as Grinex and is conducting large-scale ruble-to-crypto transactions by using Russian-backed stablecoins (such as A7A5). By the end of 2022, the trading volume of Kyrgyzstan&apos;s virtual asset service providers reached $59 million, and it soared to $4.2 billion in the first seven months of 2024. These platforms have emerged as crucial channels for Russian entities to bypass sanctions and maintain access to the global financial system.</description>
