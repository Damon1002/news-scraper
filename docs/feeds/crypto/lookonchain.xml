      <title>Analysis: Hong Kong Stablecoin License Application Intent Far Exceeds Expectations, HKMA May Issue More Licenses in the Future</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27485</link>
      <description>September 3rd. As per Aastocks, Ma Yingcong, the Director of the United Nations Hong Kong Fund Greater Bay Area Development Research, mentioned in an interview with Radio Television Hong Kong that the distinct regulatory and policy orientation of the Hong Kong Stablecoin has lured numerous institutions. Presently, the willingness to apply for a license far surpasses expectations. It is held that large technology companies are inclined to utilize stablecoins in payment scenarios, while traditional financial institutions may apply them to cross-border settlements. If the first batch of stablecoin-licensed institutions operate effectively, it will prompt the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to issue more licenses in the future.</description>
