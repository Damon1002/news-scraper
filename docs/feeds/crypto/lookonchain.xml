      <title>Dragonfly Partner: U.S. Department of Justice Has Clarified It Will Not Bring Charges Against Dragonfly or Its Employees</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22244</link>
      <description>On July 29th, regarding the news of &quot;The US Department of Justice Considering Charges Against Dragonfly Employees in the TornadoCash Case&quot;, Haseeb, a partner of Dragonfly, wrote a post again and attached a court record stating: &quot;The court record on Monday shows that the US Department of Justice has clarified that media reports about their plans to sue Dragonfly were inaccurate. Neither Dragonfly nor any of its key personnel are the subjects of their investigation. Dragonfly, as an investor, may face a lawsuit merely because it supported an open-source privacy technology. This is not only unprecedented but also clearly violates the Department of Justice&apos;s policy.&quot;</description>

      <title>Approximately $25.9 billion worth of ETH is currently staked on the Ethereum PoS network, while approximately $9.8 billion worth of ETH is waiting to be staked.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22238</link>
      <description>On July 29th, as per validatorqueue data, currently there are around 684,000 ETH (valued at approximately $25.9 billion at the present price) awaiting to exit the Ethereum PoS network, and the waiting time for exit is about 11 days and 21 hours. Meanwhile, there are approximately 259,000 ETH lined up waiting to join the network, which is about $9.8 billion, and the expected activation delay is about 4 days and 12 hours.Previously reported, this situation indicates the existence of two opposing forces in the market: on one hand, some stakers may have decided to cash out after Ethereum rebounded by more than 160% from its April low, resulting in a significant increase in the exit queue; on the other hand, new inflows of funds driven by regulatory optimism and institutional demand are also pushing up the entry queue. Listed companies such as SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion have increased their ETH holdings and are staking.</description>
