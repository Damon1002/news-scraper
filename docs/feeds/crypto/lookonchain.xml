      <title>Analyst: &quot;Average Holding Cost for BTC Held &lt;3 Months&quot; Once Again Becomes Support Level During Bitcoin Pullback</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25899</link>
      <description>August 23rd. Yesterday, on-chain data analyst Murphy posted on social media, stating that the market&apos;s concern about Powell&apos;s speech led to an early reaction, with the price dropping to $112,000 before the speech. This price just happened to be the average cost basis of &quot;BTC held for less than 3 months.&quot;Murphy further explained that BTC held for less than 3 months represents a significant portion of short-term chips and is the most active part. The emotions of these new investors are also the most easily influenced. When the price falls below the cost line and paper gains turn into paper losses, significant psychological pressure is generated, causing the market sentiment to shift from optimistic to pessimistic. This cost line happens to be at $112,000; the support comes from the fact that when these short-term investors are close to breaking even, they are reluctant to sell more chips, overall reducing selling pressure. At least they have not completely lost confidence in the future</description>

      <title>Federal Reserve&apos;s Mester: Policy Rate May Need to Be Adjusted If Labor Market Risks Worsen</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25897</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, Mohamed El-Erian of the Federal Reserve stated that the emphasis should be placed on the entire interest rate path rather than just the rate decision of a specific meeting. Inflation has been above the target level, and there are ongoing risks. The next employment report may be sufficient to demonstrate the need for a rate cut or it may not, depending on the specific details of the report. The Fed&apos;s policy will be moderately tightened. More data is required, and the rate outlook will continue to be revised until the September meeting. The risks in the labor market are increasing but have not yet become actual. It is expected that the inflationary impact of tariffs will gradually diminish. The rate path may involve a pause in rate cuts. If the risks in the labor market escalate, the policy rate may need to be adjusted. (FX678)</description>
