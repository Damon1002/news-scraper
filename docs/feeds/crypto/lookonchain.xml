      <title>Analysis: US Second Quarter Data Severely Distorted, Weak Economic Growth Expected to Continue in the Second Half of the Year</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22497</link>
      <description>July 30th: An institutional analysis indicated that, similar to the first quarter, the major GDP data in the second quarter was significantly distorted by trade. Economists advocated focusing on final sales to domestic private buyers. This is regarded by economists and policymakers as a key indicator of U.S. economic growth. After a 1.9% growth in the first quarter, this indicator grew by 1.2% in the second quarter.This was the slowest domestic demand growth since the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, economists are anticipating weak economic growth in the second half of the year. Although the White House announced a series of trade agreements, economists stated that the actual tariff rate in the U.S. still remains one of the highest levels since the 1930s. It is noted that about 60% of U.S. imports are still not affected by the agreements. (Jinshi)</description>

      <description>July 30th: During the second quarter, the U.S. GDP growth outperformed expectations and rebounded from the earlier decline that was caused by trade conflicts at the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, despite this, the overall trend of economic growth still demonstrated a slight deceleration when compared to the lower levels of recent years. The data indicates that, after excluding inflation, the initial estimation of the U.S. second-quarter real GDP annualized growth was 3%, surpassing expectations.Compared to the -0.5% in the first quarter, the growth in the second quarter witnessed a significant rebound. At the start of the year, U.S. businesses imported a substantial amount of goods in advance in order to avoid President Trump&apos;s tariff increase policy, resulting in a sharp rise in imports in the first quarter, which significantly pulled down the GDP growth of that quarter.However, in the subsequent three months, this trend has undergone a reversal.
