      <title>If Bitcoin surpasses $120,000, the mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation intensity will reach 359 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23929</link>
      <description>On August 10th, according to Coinglass data, in the event that Bitcoin surges past $120,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXes will amount to 359 million.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $117,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXes will reach 274 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart showcases to what degree reaching a certain price level will be impacted. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, it will trigger a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>The current mainstream CEX and DEX funding rate displays a divergence in market direction, with both bullish and neutral perspectives coexisting.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23928</link>
      <description>On August 10th, according to Coinglass data, the current funding rates of mainstream CEX and DEX show a divergent market trend with both bullish and neutral sentiments. The specific funding rates for major coins are as shown in the attached image.BlockBeats Note: The funding rate is a fee set by cryptocurrency exchanges to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price. It is usually applied to perpetual contracts and is a mechanism for the exchange of funds between long and short traders. The trading platform does not charge this fee. It is used to adjust the cost or profit of traders holding contracts to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.When the funding rate is 0.01%, it represents the baseline rate. When the funding rate is greater than 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market sentiment. When the funding rate is less than 0.005%, it indicates a generally bearish market sentiment.</description>

      <description>August 10th.

It appears that the whale has finally made a decision to liquidate its position half an hour ago. If it were to sell all of its holdings, it would achieve a profit of $1.066 million, with a return on investment of 237%.</description>
