      <title>What Trump Did This Morning: Accused Non-Farm Payroll Data of Falsification and Fired the Labor Bureau Director, Dispatched a Nuclear Submarine Near Russian-Adjacent Region</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22888</link>
      <description>August 2nd. Yesterday, following the release of the non-farm payroll data, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics made significant downward revisions to the May and June non-farm payroll data. The non-farm employment increase in May was revised from 144,000 to 19,000; the non-farm employment increase in June was revised from 147,000 to 14,000. After the revision, the combined May and June non-farm employment numbers were 258,000 lower than previously reported.U.S. President Trump directly pointed out in a tweet that &quot;this is a scam against him&quot;: &quot;In my view, today&apos;s job data has been manipulated to humiliate Republicans and meâ€”just as before and after the 2024 presidential election. First, they presented three days of excellent data, and then on November 15, 2024, shortly after the election, this data was significantly revised downwardâ€”a complete scam.&quot; Trump then ordered the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, and his deputy William Wiatrowski served</description>

      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $112,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation pressure will reach $1.09 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22887</link>
      <description>August 2nd. Based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin drops below $112,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will amount to $1.09 billion.On the other hand, if Bitcoin rebounds to $116,713, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $2.504 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the precise number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of the contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows how much the underlying price will be affected when it reaches a certain position. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price is likely to experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade once it reaches that level.</description>
