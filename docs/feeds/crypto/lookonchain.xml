There is an exemption for companies committed to building factories in the US, which benefits Apple (AAPL) and several other tech giants. Apple and CEO Cook simultaneously unveiled a $100 billion US manufacturing investment plan to expand their domestic supply chain layout. This move has been regarded by the market as Trump&apos;s policy of &quot;using tariffs to force fund repatriation&quot; being specifically carried out.In the crypto market, cryptocurrencies related to AI, computing power, and decentralized supply chains have witnessed capital replenishment.
