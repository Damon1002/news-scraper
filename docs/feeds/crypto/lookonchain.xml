      <title>Trump Ally Sues Powell, Calls for FOMC Meeting Transparency</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21745</link>
      <description>July 25th: A firm with the backing of supporters of U.S. President Trump has initiated a lawsuit against Federal Reserve Chairman Powell and other Fed officials, demanding that the Fed conduct its monetary policy meetings in an open manner. The U.S. investor James Fishback&apos;s company, Azoria Capital, stated in a lawsuit filed on Thursday that the FOMC&apos;s long-standing practice of holding closed-door meetings was in violation of government transparency laws.The fund filed the lawsuit with a federal court in Washington and demanded that the Fed hold an open meeting from July 29th to 30th. The company noted in the lawsuit: &quot;Azoria is highly concerned that under Powell&apos;s leadership, the FOMC has maintained high interest rates, which has had a negative impact on President Trump and his economic agenda, and has also damaged U.S. citizens and the U.S. economy.&quot; (FX678)</description>
