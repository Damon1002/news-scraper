      <title>Justin Sun: No Reason to Doubt High-Yield Staking, Interest Subsidized by Corporate Profits</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27680</link>
      <description>On September 4th, Justin Sun responded to the inquiries regarding the &quot;Huobi HTX High-Yield Financial Product&quot; as follows:Similar to the popular instant rewards (free lunch) in the current industry, the high-yield interest rate is 100% subsidized by the group. This is essentially done to compete for users among trading platforms. The subsidy logic is also very straightforward: user growth leads to trading volume growth, which is worthwhile in the long run.Huobi HTX is still in the early stage of growth and will consider other factors after increasing asset immersion.The Merkel Tree proof has been released for nearly 34 months, ensuring fund transparency.The current group has an annual profit of tens of billions of US dollars. Therefore, no one should question our ability to subsidize, right?Finally, Justin Sun stated that there is no reason to question the Huobi HTX demand deposit financial product as funds can be withdrawn directly.</description>

      <title>Analysis: Bitcoin Encounters Short-Term Cost Line Resistance, Increased Inflow of Funds Suggests Intensified Long vs Short Battle</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27672</link>
      <description>On September 4th, on-chain data analyst Murphy elaborated on the potential for a post-balanced game on Binance following the accelerated growth of stablecoin balances. This morning, BTC peaked at $112,575 before encountering resistance, demonstrating the suppression of the short-term chip&apos;s average cost line at $112,700 and validating the rationality of analyzing the market from the viewpoints of short-term holder sentiment and holding mentality. The failure to break through the resistance level this time does not signify the end of the uptrend; there remains room for game theory. It was observed that since BTC entered a pullback on August 13th, Binance&apos;s mainstream stablecoin balance (USDT + USDC) has witnessed rapid and substantial growth.From August 13th to September 3rd, there was a net increase of $4.9 billion, which far exceeded the stablecoin balance growth during the same time period after BTC entered a pullback in August 2024 ($3.4 billion) and March 2025 ($2.8 billion).
