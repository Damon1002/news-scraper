      <title>Vitalik: Excited about an open-source AI model with contextual weighting and real-time editing capabilities, looking forward to brain-machine interface collaborations.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24043</link>
      <description>August 11th, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin shared in a post, saying, &quot;At present, many artificial intelligence developments are aiming to make systems as &apos;autonomous&apos; as they can be. However, in reality, creating more channels for human participation not only leads to better results (and this is likely to remain the case for a long time in the future), but is also more beneficial for security.&quot;&quot;Today, I am much more inclined towards AI models that are open-source weighted and have good &apos;editing&apos; capabilities rather than models that are simply created from scratch.&quot;&quot;In the medium term, I hope for a certain kind of advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that can provide me with real-time feedback while generating content and detect my sentiments towards each part, and then make adjustments based on the feedback.&quot;</description>
