      <title>Goldman Sachs: The Current Market Is Experiencing the Beginning of a Stablecoin &apos;Gold Rush&apos;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25518</link>
      <description>August 21st. A research report issued by Will Nance and others from Goldman Sachs Bank indicated that the current market is at the outset of a stablecoin &quot;gold rush.&quot;The report stated: &quot;Stablecoins represent a global market worth $2.71 trillion. We think that USDC will gain from the growth of its market share both within and outside Binance&apos;s platform. As the ongoing stablecoin legislation legitimizes the ecosystem and as the crypto ecosystem expands, which may also be triggered by legislation. Based on current trends and announced initiatives, USDC is anticipated to grow by $770 billion from 2024 to 2027, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40%.&quot;The bank concluded, &quot;Therefore, in the long term, the payment sector is the most evident source of stablecoin expansion. This opportunity has hardly been tapped so far, with most stablecoin activities being driven by cryptocurrency trading and non-US dollar demands outside the US.&quot; (Jinse)</description>

      <title>The ETH balance in the Ethereum PoS network&apos;s Exit Queue has dropped to 878,000 ETH, while over 200,000 ETH are waiting to join.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25516</link>
      <description>On August 21st, according to the data from the Validator Queue tracking website validatorqueue, the current exit queue on the Ethereum PoS network is temporarily reported to be 878,966 ETH, which is approximately worth $37.7 billion. This shows some relief compared to the previous all-time high.At the same time, the amount of ETH queued to join the network is about 203,206, and it is also showing a downward trend.Previously reported, this situation reflects the existence of two opposing forces in the market. On the one hand, some stakers may choose to cash out after Ethereum&apos;s significant rise since the April low, resulting in a surge in the exit queue. On the other hand, new inflows of funds driven by regulatory optimism and institutional demand are also boosting the entry queue. For example, listed companies like SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion are increasing their ETH holdings and staking.</description>

      <title>Insight: The LP set by YZY developers can result in traders facing an implicit fee rate of 4-5%, due to excessive slippage</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25515</link>
      <description>On August 21st, according to the crypto Key Opinion Leader @0xBiZzy, the YZY developer-set LP managed to earn nearly $10 million in transaction fees within just a few hours. What is even more remarkable is that the Bin Step (price range) of the LP was set too high (100 instead of the usual 50), which led to traders facing an implied fee rate of 4-5%. This indicates that the total cost for traders to enter and exit the transaction amounted to approximately 10%.</description>

      <title>View: Fed&apos;s Powell May Stay Neutral at Jackson Hole Conference</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25514</link>
      <description>On August 21st, Blerina Uruci, the Chief U.S. Economist of T. Rowe Price, stated that during the Jackson Hole meeting, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell&apos;s speech may lay emphasis on maintaining maximum flexibility for the upcoming FOMC meetings and suggest that the policy path will be contingent upon inflation and labor market data.She pointed out that prior to the Fed meeting on September 17th, there will also be a jobs report and a CPI report. In the event that inflation rises significantly or the labor market exhibits strong improvement, the likelihood of keeping rates unchanged at the next meeting is higher; if August job growth drops to below 50,000 per month and the unemployment rate rises, there may be a dovish rate cut of 50 basis points.

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25510</link>
      <description>August 21st. OnChain joined forces with Cactus Custody to tokenize the CCB International USD Money Market Fund as a Real World Asset (RWA) within an on-chain operation. This offers investors an auditable on-chain investment option. The fund was established on February 2nd, 2024, and as of July 31st, 2025, it ranked first in the Bloomberg Asia-Pacific category. It leads the market with characteristics like transparency, low volatility, and a verifiable net asset value. This collaboration directly addresses four major pain points in on-chain wealth management:· The lack of on-chain auditable custodial cash equivalents;· The low efficiency in bank-to-on-chain fund transfers;· The difficulty in unifying risk control audits across multiple legal jurisdictions;· The liquidity fragmentation across multiple chains.OnChain provides RWA on-chain technology services. The net asset value is calculated off-chain and regularly brought onto the chain. Shareholding and transfer are subject to whi</description>
