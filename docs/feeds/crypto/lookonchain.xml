      <title>Matrixport: If Ethereum Fails to Hold $4180, Further Pullback Risk Remains</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25164</link>
      <description>On August 19th, Matrixport shared today&apos;s market insights as follows: The inflow of funds into the Ethereum ETF mainly stems from the establishment and expansion of &quot;treasury-like companies.&quot; Whether the future market can continue to rise depends on the continuous accumulation of these institutions, especially in the context where on-chain activity remains sluggish.Although stablecoin issuance is more concentrated on Ethereum and the future incremental space is generally optimistic, this advantage mainly reflects the medium- to long-term potential and has a limited contribution to income in the short term.From a technical perspective, if Ethereum fails to hold above the $4,180 key level, there is still a risk of further downward correction.</description>

      <title>Henan Provincial Legal Committee: The Ministry of Public Security is studying the related system of virtual currencies involved in cases, and local legislation is not appropriate.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25161</link>
      <description>Recently, the Standing Committee of the Henan Provincial People&apos;s Congress released a report on the deliberation results of the &quot;Henan Province Management Regulations on Property Involved in Cases (Draft),&quot; which brought up issues related to the handling of virtual currency involved in cases.The Henan Provincial Legislative Affairs Commission holds the view that &quot;virtual currency has property attributes and belongs to property involved in cases. A basic consensus has been reached in judicial practice. However, virtual currency transactions in China are completely prohibited, and there is no legal trading platform. How to dispose of virtual currency is still a subject of exploration in various places. Currently, the Ministry of Public Security is researching and formulating relevant regulations on virtual currency. It is more appropriate to uniformly regulate the management of this new type of property involved in cases at the national level. Our local legislation should not make rele</description>

      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin May Remain Range-Bound, Market Focuses on Powell&apos;s Speech This Friday</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25159</link>
      <description>On August 19th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. posted and stated, &quot;The sentiment index in the futures market has dropped below the neutral zone to 36%. From August 11th to 14th, as the Bitcoin price surged to $123,000, this index briefly rose to 70%. Currently, the Bitcoin price is maintaining at $115,000, and the momentum of the sentiment index is decreasing: in the index composition, sellers dominate in the short term (net traders and volume difference are negative), while open interest contracts remain neutral. This indicates that the market has transitioned from a state of euphoric sentiment at the peak to a range-bound phase.&quot;This state implies that when the index is still below 45-50%, a rebound may trigger selling pressure, and the price is likely to fluctuate in a narrow range. If the index continues to be lackluster during a weak rebound, it may increase the testing of $112,000. The key this week is Powell&apos;s speech at the Jackson Hole summit on Friday (economic outlook a</description>
