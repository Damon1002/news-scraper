In an interview, Rowton stated that the index provider is adopting a &quot;strategic approach&quot; to ensure that tokenized S&amp;P products are only launched when certain high standards of transparency, security, and regulatory compliance are met.She mentioned, &quot;By establishing these types of partnerships, we hope to jointly contribute to the construction of a robust infrastructure that can support the trading and accessibility of our index tokenized versions, ultimately enhancing the investor experience.&quot; This move into the blockchain realm occurs as institutional interest in tokenized financial products is on the rise.

      <title>Bitunix Analyst: Putin&apos;s Meeting Failed to Deliver Substantial Positive News, BTC Stuck in Range-Bound Trading, Resistance at $120,600, Limited Upside Potential</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24879</link>
      <description>August 16th: The &quot;Putin-Biden Summit in Alaska&quot; came to an end. Although it was the longest face-to-face interaction between the two leaders, it ultimately failed to yield specific results. Trump characterized it as &quot;productive but no agreement reached yet,&quot; while Putin emphasized a constructive atmosphere and mentioned &quot;reaching some undisclosed agreements.&quot; However, the market found it difficult to obtain clear signals in such an &quot;upbeat atmosphere with empty content.&quot; This has intensified concerns in Europe and Kyiv, and global markets still maintain a high level of sensitivity to geopolitical risks.The short-term performance of the crypto market has been characterized by fluctuating back and forth. BTC has been oscillating repeatedly within the range of 119,200–116,400, forming a support zone. The concentrated liquidation area above is around 119,600, and there is even greater pressure at 120,000. Order book data shows that the chips have not yet made a significant breakthrough,</description>

      <title>Next Week Macro Outlook: Powell&apos;s &quot;Battle&quot; Against Market Rate Cut Expectations, Fed Releases Monetary Policy Meeting Minutes</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24875</link>
      <description>Update, August 16th. During the past week, U.S. economic data has been a combination of positive and negative, resulting in continuous market volatility in the anticipation of a Fed rate cut. The data released on Friday showed that driven by robust auto sales and extensive online promotions, U.S. retail sales experienced broad-based growth. However, a subsequent report indicated an unexpected decrease in consumer confidence, which was the first since April, along with a rise in inflation expectations.Previously, the U.S. July CPI and PPI reports seemed to convey conflicting signals regarding whether the economy is withstanding the impact of Trump&apos;s comprehensive import tariffs, but both pointed to persistent service inflation, with PPI reaching a three-year high on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, there is evident internal disagreement within the Fed regarding a September rate cut.At 11:00 PM on Wednesday, Fed Governor Waller gave a speech at a blockchain seminar in Wyoming; at 2:00 AM</description>
