      <title>Analysis: Pump.fun&apos;s planned increase in token buyback ratio has not been confirmed yet, and the community should remain cautious</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22323</link>
      <description>On July 29th, Dumpster DAO released an analysis on the &quot;market rumor that Pump.fun will increase the token buyback ratio and use 100% of daily revenue for buyback&quot;: After closely monitoring the situation, it alerts the community to carefully observe on-chain data. Currently, Pump.fun only uses the recent 100% income for token buyback. Although in the past few days, Pump.fun bundled 100% of the income for token buyback, it was not fully implemented, raising doubts that they are misleading on-chain observers. Additionally, these tokens have never been burned or transferred anywhere, and there is currently no official announcement of a buyback system.</description>
