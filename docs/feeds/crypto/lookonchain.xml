      <title>glassnode: The current downturn experienced a relatively low liquidation volume, indicating that it was primarily driven by the spot market.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22798</link>
      <description>On August 1st, based on the data from the analysis platform glassnode, although Bitcoin dropped by 3.2% and Ethereum by 6%, the market liquidation scale remained at a low level, amounting to only $110 million and $132 million respectively. The slight withdrawal of open interest suggests that this round of correction is mainly driven by the spot market rather than the derivatives market.</description>

Friday&apos;s July nonfarm payroll report will be a part of the puzzle that will assist in shaping expectations for a September Fed rate cut.Analysts note that if the nonfarm payroll data is below 100,000 and the unemployment rate rises, it may imply a weakening job mark</description>
