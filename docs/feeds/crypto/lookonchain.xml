      <title>Trader Eugene: Simply buying ETH and holding for three months will be simpler than chasing hot coins on-chain.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22335</link>
      <description>On July 29th, Trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio expressed his views on the market trend for the upcoming months. He stated, &quot;In my opinion, after a risk adjustment, the number of coins that can outperform BTC and ETH in the coming months will be quite limited. Certainly, there may be some unexpected meme coins that experience a sudden surge. However, betting on these coins in advance is similar to playing a highly difficult game. Now that the market has reached a relatively high level, I may be more inclined to hold mainstream coins and reduce high-risk speculative trading. Instead of chasing the next hot coin on-chain and experiencing significant volatility, it is much simpler to simply buy and hold ETH for three months without taking any action and then sell it to earn a 50% profit.&quot;</description>
