      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26157</link>
      <description>On August 25th, based on Coinglass data, the current funding rates of mainstream CEX and DEX suggest a slightly bearish sentiment in the market.

It is usually applicable to perpetual contracts and serves as a funding exchange mechanism between long and short traders. The trading platform does not charge this fee. Its purpose is to adjust the cost or profit of traders holding contracts to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.When the funding rate is 0.01%, it represents the baseline rate. When the funding rate is higher than 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market. When the funding rate is lower than 0.005%, it suggests a generally bearish market.</description>

      <title>Reuters: U.S. Bank Lobbies to Block Payment of Interest with Stablecoin Due to Concerns About Deposit Outflows</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26152</link>
      <description>On August 25th, as per Reuters, Bank of America is advocating for amendments to the new stablecoin regulatory rules. It is concerned that these rules might lead to a multi-trillion-dollar capital outpour. This also underscores the escalating competition between Wall Street and the cryptocurrency industry.Last week, bank lobbying groups such as the American Bankers Association (ABA), the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), and the Consumer Bankers Association (CBA) alerted lawmakers to the &quot;loopholes&quot; in the regulations that could enable some cryptocurrency exchanges to indirectly offer interest to stablecoin holders.The Genius Act, which was passed by the U.S. Congress in July, is intended to regulate the $2.88 trillion global stablecoin market. The law prohibits issuers from providing &quot;yield&quot; or interest to customers. Under the new regulations, banks are permitted to issue their own stablecoins but are not allowed to pay any interest.</description>
