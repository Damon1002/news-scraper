      <title>The UST and Luna Crash Saga Nears its End as Terra Founder Do Kwon Pleads Guilty</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24258</link>
      <description>August 12th: During a hearing in a U.S. court, Terra&apos;s founder, Do Kwon, entered a guilty plea to two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and wire fraud. These charges are related to the previous $40 billion TerraUSD (UST) and Luna collapse.Do Kwon, who was born in Seoul, South Korea in 1991, co-founded Terraform Labs in Singapore in 2018 with others. They launched the algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and the governance token Luna, which were once regarded as an innovative benchmark in DeFi. In May 2022, due to algorithmic imbalance, TerraUSD detached from the U.S. dollar, resulting in a sharp decline in the prices of Luna and UST. The market value nearly reached zero, triggering market panic and a chain reaction. This further plunged the crypto market into the abyss of a bear market. Global investors suffered approximately $40 billion in losses, and as a result, Do Kwon was charged with financial fraud.</description>

      <title>Goldman Sachs: CPI Data Supports Expectation of Fed&apos;s &apos;Insurance&apos; Rate Cut in September</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24256</link>
      <description>On August 12th, Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, the Co-Chief Information Officer for Global Multi-Asset Solutions at Goldman Sachs, declared that the July CPI data met the expectations. The year-on-year core inflation rate increased by 3.1%. The data supported the Fed, which believed that the impact of tariffs on price levels was mostly temporary. Tariffs did not lead to significant price hikes as businesses offset cost pressures by reducing inventory and adjusting prices cautiously. This was mainly because consumers were very price-sensitive. The Fed&apos;s policy was highly data-dependent. With inflation under control and signs of a weakening labor market in the revised employment data, future focus would be more on employment. Overall, this inflation report supported the expectation that the Fed might implement an &quot;insurance&quot; interest rate cut in September, and this would be a key driver for the market.
