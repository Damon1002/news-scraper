      <title>U.S. July Consumer Spending and Inflation Rise Together, but Weak Jobs Data May Pave the Way for Fed Rate Cut</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26887</link>
      <description>August 29th: In July, U.S. consumer spending demonstrated a solid growth. Meanwhile, the core PCE witnessed a slight upward trend as the prices of some goods rose due to import tariffs. Nevertheless, against the backdrop of the softening labor market conditions, these data might not prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates next month. The low unemployment rate is sustaining steady wage growth, which provides support for consumption.However, President Trump&apos;s imposition of tariffs on imported goods is elevating business costs, intensifying corporate caution and causing employers to be reluctant to increase hiring. Government reports this month indicated that during the past three months up to July, employment has been increasing at an average rate of 35,000 people per month, in contrast to 123,000 people during the same period in 2024.

      <title>Tether Updates Old Blockchain Transition Plan: Will Not Freeze Smart Contracts on the Network</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26888</link>
      <description>August 29th. Stablecoin issuer Tether declared today an update regarding its transition plan for five legacy blockchains, namely Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand. More than a year ago, Tether announced its intention to halt the redemption and freezing of USDT tokens on these legacy blockchains starting from September 1, 2025, with a gradual phasing out of support.In response to feedback from the discontinued blockchain communities, Tether has adjusted this approach and will not freeze smart contracts on these networks. Although users can still transfer tokens between wallets, Tether will discontinue the direct issuance and redemption of tokens on these blockchains. This indicates that these tokens will no longer receive official support like other Tether tokens. Tether remains dedicated to a smooth transition and will continue to cooperate with the community to ensure transparency and clarity throughout the entire process.</description>

      <title>Point of View: Ethereum Price Action Shows Weakness But Has Not Peaked Yet, Merely in a Seasonal Trend</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26881</link>
      <description>On August 29th, trader CoinMamba made a post stating, &quot;The market appears to be a bit weak. However, when I took another look at the ETH chart, in my view, we have not yet reached the peak. We are merely going through a normal seasonal trend.&quot;BlockBeats had previously reported that on August 26th, Matrixport said, &quot;Most of the institutional funds during summer have exited. But Ethereum continues to attract inflows, while Bitcoin ETF may experience net outflows for the fifth consecutive month. The outflow this month is estimated to be around $1.2 billion, which is the second-highest in history, only next to February&apos;s $3.5 billion. Seasonal factors may be temporary, but they remind us that fund flows are as important as seasonality. After maintaining a bullish stance in July, we became cautious in August. Although macro and liquidity factors may still support Bitcoin, the current market still needs to remain vigilant.&quot;</description>
