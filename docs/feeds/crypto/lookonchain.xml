      <title>Citi expects the 10-year US Treasury bond yield to reach 4.10% by the end of the year</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26117</link>
      <description>August 25th: Jason Williams, a strategist at Citigroup, stated in a report that Citigroup has made some minor updates to its year-end yield level forecast for US Treasuries. Nevertheless, the institution remains confident in its long-standing forecast for the 10-year bond yield.He pointed out that the institution still anticipates that the 10-year US Treasury bond yield will reach 4.10% by the end of the year, which is in line with its forecast since last year. However, Citigroup has moderately adjusted other benchmarks in order to better align with its view of a steeper yield curve and lower policy rate expectations for 2026. Citigroup&apos;s new base forecasts for the two-year US Treasury bond yield are 3.50%; the five-year bond yield is 3.65%, and the 30-year bond yield is 4.70%. (FXStreet)</description>
