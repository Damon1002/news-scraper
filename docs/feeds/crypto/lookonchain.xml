For the first time, he acknowledged that LIBRA is a Meme token and denied that it is an investment project with a business plan. This contradicts the claim made by President Javier Milei that it &quot;supports the Argentine economy.&quot;Davis&apos;s defense attorney admitted that the Meme token &quot;is not an investment, has no intrinsic value, but is an unsecured and uncollateralized asset with speculative and collectible characteristics, and its market volatility is extremely high.&quot; Meanwhile, another fund transaction came to light.

      <description>On July 26th, during an Artificial Intelligence summit held in Washington D.C., U.S. President Trump declared that he had earnestly contemplated breaking up NVIDIA in order to disrupt the company&apos;s AI chip monopoly and boost industry competition. Trump recollected, &quot;Before I grasped the facts, I remarked, &apos;We are going to disassemble this company.&apos;&quot; Nevertheless, after receiving a briefing from his staff, he became aware that NVIDIA had already achieved a prominent advantage in technology and the ecosystem, making it challenging to be replaced in the short run.Ultimately, he conceded, &quot;This is not a simple matter.&quot; More significantly, Trump subsequently publicly commended NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and engaged with him on the spot. Huang responded in kind on the stage, stating, &quot;The unique advantage of the United States is something that other countries do not possess, that is President Trump.&quot; The mutual &quot;praise&quot; between the two regarding AI policy implies Trump&apos;s pursuit of a more bal</description>
