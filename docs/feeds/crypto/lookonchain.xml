      <title>Analyst: BTC Volatility Hits New Two-Year Low, Signaling Potential Imminent Spike</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24574</link>
      <description>On August 14th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. put forward that, &quot;Based on the 30-day high-low price indicator, the volatility of Bitcoin has been compressed to the lowest level in two years: the range between the highest and lowest prices within the past 30 days has become narrower, and the range formed by the rolling high/low prices has constricted the price within it. This compression typically indicates a balance between supply and demand and low realized volatility. When liquidity is concentrated at local highs (above $120,000) and lows (below $113,000), such a situation emerges. The possibility of the expansion of the price range is on the rise.&quot;</description>

      <title>If Ethereum Breaks its All-Time High, Mainstream CEX Cumulative Short Liquidation Pressure Will Reach $2.218 Billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24569</link>
      <description>On August 14th, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum manages to break through the $4868 all-time high, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $2.218 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum drops below $4600, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $3.342 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows the extent to which the price of the underlying asset will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that once the price reaches that level, a more intense reaction will occur due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
