      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23634</link>
      <description>August 8th, Base tweeted that on the Base app, creators have the opportunity to earn income when users engage with their content. Each time a post is bought or sold, the creator will directly receive a fee into their wallet. Commencing from today, Base will start to support creators in this new global economic model by collecting minted content.In addition, Base declared that this series is not intended for investment returns and is not financial advice; it is advisable that you conduct your own research. Base plans to hold these tokens indefinitely and will neither trade nor sell them. We think that creators should be directly rewarded for their creativity and hope to show how creators can make a profit from their content.</description>
