      <title>CryptoQuant CEO: Bitcoin Cycle Theory has Become Outdated, Rise of Institutional Long-Term Holders</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21765</link>
      <description>On July 25th, Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, stated in a post on the X platform that the &quot;Bitcoin cycle theory has failed. My previous predictions were based on this theory - buy when whales start accumulating and sell when retail investors start entering. But this pattern is no longer valid.&quot;&quot;In the previous cycle, whales sold coins to retail investors. However, this time, old whales sold coins to new long-term holders. The scale of institutional investment far exceeded our expectations. Trading has become meaningless, and now the number of holders has surpassed the number of traders. I overlooked this structural change when making the call for the end of the bull market.&quot;</description>
