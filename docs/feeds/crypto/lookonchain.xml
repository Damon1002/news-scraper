      <title>BiyaPay Analyst: US July CPI Forecast Data &apos;Hotter Than Expected&apos;, BTC May Retest $110,000 Support</title>

      <description>On August 12th, Qubic gave a response regarding the Monero 51% attack incident, stating, &quot;The Monero (XMR) experiment is moving forward as scheduled, and everything will be disclosed at the right moment.&quot;Previously, it was reported that Sergey Ivancheglo, the co-founder of IOTA, through his project Qubic, rapidly amassed a significant amount of Monero (XMR) hash power using the &quot;useful Proof of Work (uPoW)&quot; mechanism.
