      <title>Trader Eugene: ETH seems sufficiently resilient, has opened long positions on ETH and SUI</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21899</link>
      <description>On July 26th, Trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio shared on his personal channel, saying, &quot;As of today, considering the overall defense of altcoins against BTC, I have initiated some long positions. This is a short-term trade on a low time frame (LTF) rather than a hold on a high time frame (HTF). Nevertheless, ETH appears to be resilient enough to maintain the $3500 level. Presently, I am holding long positions in ETH and SUI. If ETH drops below the low point of $3500, the trade will be nullified.&quot;</description>

      <title>Dragonfly Partner Responds to Potential US Department of Justice Charges: Fully Intends to Defend Itself</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21898</link>
      <description>On July 26th, Haseeb, a partner of Dragonfly, responded to the news that &quot;The U.S. Department of Justice is considering charging DragonFly employees in the Tornado Cash case&quot; by stating, &quot;Dragonfly invested in PepperSec, Inc., the developer of Tornado Cash, in August 2020. This was because they recognized the importance of open-source privacy protection technology. Prior to the investment, Dragonfly obtained external legal advice confirming that the development of Tornado Cash was in compliance with the law and in line with the guidelines issued by FinCEN, an agency of the U.S. Treasury Department, in 2019. The U.S. government has publicly stated in court that they are considering charges against Dragonfly. Based on legal advice, we have decided not to make public comments at this time, but we have chosen not to remain silent.&quot;&quot;We firmly believe that Americans have the right to privacy. The lack of privacy remains one of the biggest unresolved problems in the cryptocurrency field. Th</description>

      <title>Coinbase CEO Clarifies Addition of RSC to Listing Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21895</link>
      <description>On July 26th, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, clarified the announcement &quot;Coinbase to Add ResearchCoin (RSC) to Listing Roadmap&quot;:&quot;We, as the co-founder of ResearchHub, would like to share some details about the precautions we took a few years ago to eliminate conflicts of interest. All assets listed on Coinbase go through the review of our Digital Asset Support Group (DASG). DASG conducts a review of all assets listed on Coinbase from legal, compliance, and cybersecurity perspectives. I am not a member of DASG, so I do not have voting power to decide which assets receive listing approval. My relationship with ResearchHub has been disclosed to the Coinbase Board, which is a standard practice. I wrote a blog post on this topic in March 2022 and publicly committed not to sell RSC for at least four years, and this commitment remains unchanged.&quot;</description>

      <title>Another Appearance of Ancient BTC Whale After 14.5 Years of Dormancy, Holding Assets Worth Approximately $457 Million</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21892</link>
      <description>On July 25th, according to on-chain analyst AI Auntie (@ai_9684xtpa), the sell-off pressure from an ancient whale that holds 80,000 BTC is coming to an end. Meanwhile, another dormant whale that has been holding coins for 14.5 years may be getting ready to sell. The address &quot;bc1qsea3m&quot; made its first external transfer since January 2011 yesterday. And the receiving address moved 50 BTC to the address &quot;bc1q5&quot; 2 hours ago. The ownership of this receiving address is unknown, but it has interacted with addresses related to Coinbase, B2C2, and Galaxy Digital. The ancient whale holds 3,963 BTC, which is approximately $457 million, and its cost basis per coin is astonishingly low at $0.32.</description>
