      <title>Arthur Hayes: Expects USD Stablecoin Supply to Reach $10 Trillion by 2028, Triggering DeFi Bull Run</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26614</link>
      <description>August 28th. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, recently released an article stating that by 2028, the total supply of USD-pegged stablecoins in circulation is projected to reach at least $10 trillion. This figure is significant considering the enormous and exponentially increasing deficit that the United States has to bear. The more Bezos finances the government with Treasury bills, the quicker the debt accumulates as he needs to roll over the debt annually.Consequently, this represents a once-in-a-century transformation of the global monetary architecture. &quot;Perhaps, we will never encounter such an event again in our investment careers. You will never witness such a bull market in the foundational pillars of DeFi as these foundational pillars are reaping great benefits from the surge of USD-pegged stablecoins.&quot;</description>

      <title>VanEck CEO: Ethereum is the &quot;Wall Street Token,&quot; Stablecoin Growth Drives Traditional Financial Institutions&apos; Demand for Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26608</link>
      <description>On August 28th, Jan F. van Eck, the CEO and president of VanEck, stated in an interview with FOX News that Ethereum is what I refer to as a &quot;Wall Street Token.&quot; With the emergence of stablecoins, every bank - in fact, every financial services firm - must find a way to accept stablecoins. If I want to send you a stablecoin, your bank has to figure it out; otherwise, you will go to another institution that can handle it. &quot;The people on Wall Street will eventually turn around and ask: What exactly is this thing? On which chain should I develop? The answer is Ethereum.&quot;Jan F. van Eck also stated that Ethereum was indeed despised by many earlier this year at its low point for various reasons. VanEck actually has a list of &quot;actively managed ETFs.&quot;</description>

      <title>Former US Treasury Secretary Yellen: Firing Cook is illegal and dangerous, US credibility is at risk</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26605</link>
      <description>August 28th: In reaction to the controversy that was triggered by Trump&apos;s dismissal of Federal Reserve Board Governor Powell, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen stated: Trump claims to have &quot;fired&quot; Powell with &quot;valid reasons.&quot; This action is not only illegal but also extremely perilous.This is a blatant attempt to politicize the Federal Reserve. It is a threat to its leadership and an attempt to make monetary policy bow to the will of the president. Such an action could lead to the end of the Fed&apos;s independence—and what will follow is the collapse of the credibility of U.S. monetary policy at home and abroad.Yellen calls on Congress to safeguard the Fed&apos;s independence. The courts must reject this illegal abuse of power. The financial industry should also voice its opposition to this direct attack on the credibility of the dollar. (FXStreet)</description>
