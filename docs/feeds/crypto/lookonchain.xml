      <title>Goldman Sachs: Fed Expected to Cut Rates by 25 Basis Points in September, Five-Year Treasury Notes are the Best Trade Before Rate Cut</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25184</link>
      <description>On August 19th, Shifrin, the Global Head of Banking and Markets Strategy at Goldman Sachs, stated that while the Federal Reserve may cut rates, the five-year U.S. Treasury bond is currently the most attractive trading option. He pointed out that a yield range of 3%-4% for the five-year bond is a level worthy of investment and can also provide protection during periods of rising market risk.The current yield on the five-year U.S. Treasury bond is 3.85%, which is significantly lower than 4.38% at the beginning of the year. A Reuters survey shows that 61% of economists expect the Fed to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4%-4.25% range at the September meeting.Goldman Sachs predicts that considering the slowdown in real GDP growth and the rise in the unemployment rate, the Fed may start a rate cut cycle in the fourth quarter of 2025 and continue with accommodative policies in 2026, ultimately adjusting the policy rate to the 3%-3.25% level.

Major investment banks hold the following expectations for Powell&apos;s speech:UBS: It is anticipated that Powell may lay the groundwork for a rate cut commencing in September and persisting through the end of the year.UBS: Considering last week&apos;s data, Powell may be inclined to hint at the Fed&apos;s propensity to cut rates during the September meeting.Russell Investments: The Jackson Hole meeting may temper expectations for a Fed rate cut.
