      <title>KyberSwap Introduces FairFlow, MEV Revenue Selectively Returned to LP</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23224</link>
      <description>On August 5th, KyberSwap declared that it is set to launch a novel LP reward mechanism named FairFlow on August 6th. FairFlow is a Swap Hook based on Uniswap V4, aiming to return the arbitrage profits that were originally grabbed by external MEV arbitrageurs back to the liquidity providers (LPs). LPs can obtain rewards without staking LP tokens.The core mechanism is the Equilibrium Gain (EG) sharing plan: KyberSwap&apos;s aggregator integrates with the FairFlow pool. When a trade presents an arbitrage opportunity, the FairFlow Hook seizes a portion of the profit and distributes 70% proportionally to LPs, with 30% allocated to the platform&apos;s ecosystem. EG rewards are distributed weekly in a dual token format, and LP tokens can be used in other DeFi protocols simultaneously to earn additional yield.According to the official experimental data, the APR of the FairFlow pool is higher than that of traditional pools. For instance, in the ETH-cbBTC pair on the Base network, within 189 hours, th</description>
