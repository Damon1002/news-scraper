      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4600, the total long liquidation on major CEXs will reach $2.401 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25928</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum drops below $4600, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs in terms of long positions will reach $2.401 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum rises above $4900, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs in terms of short positions will reach $1.540 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not accurately show the number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity. Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the underlying price will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that when the price reaches that level, it will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>
