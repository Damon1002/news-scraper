      <title>CryptoQuant CEO: Bitcoin Cycle Theory has Become Outdated, Rise of Institutional Long-Term Holders</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21765</link>
      <description>On July 25th, Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, stated in a post on the X platform that the &quot;Bitcoin cycle theory has failed. My previous predictions were based on this theory - buy when whales start accumulating and sell when retail investors start entering. But this pattern is no longer valid.&quot;&quot;In the previous cycle, whales sold coins to retail investors. However, this time, old whales sold coins to new long-term holders. The scale of institutional investment far exceeded our expectations. Trading has become meaningless, and now the number of holders has surpassed the number of traders. I overlooked this structural change when making the call for the end of the bull market.&quot;</description>

      <description>On July 25th, as per Bloomberg, for the majority of experienced crypto traders, the &quot;Altcoin Season&quot; is nearly a regular cycle. Firstly, Bitcoin rises, igniting renewed enthusiasm in the digital asset market. Funds flow into this predominant cryptocurrency, while the interest in &quot;altcoins&quot; gradually wanes. Traders begin to look elsewhere in search of higher returns, giving rise to new stories and narratives. Subsequently, funds rotate into lagging coins, resulting in outsized gains. This phenomenon led speculators to coin the term &quot;Altcoin Season&quot; during the 2017 - 2018 bull market.On July 14th, driven by the enthusiasm of &quot;Crypto Week&quot;, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high before entering a narrow trading range. Key figures in the digital asset space and investors hailed Ethereum&apos;s breakout and the rebound of the long-suffering NFT sector as a turning point. However, this cycle has been more sporadic in nature rather than a broad-based altcoin boom. XRP surged by over 60% since early</description>
