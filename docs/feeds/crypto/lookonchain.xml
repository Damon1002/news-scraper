      <title>Analysis: The main force behind this round of Ethereum short selling is suspected to be a hedge fund</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25321</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Ethereum recently experienced a significant surge and reached nearly $5,000, which triggered a bullish rally. Nevertheless, this crucial level was not successfully broken through as sellers once again took the upper hand and forced the price to decline. A considerable amount of the downward pressure seems to originate from large hedge funds that continue to have heavy short positions in the second-largest cryptocurrency.When the Ethereum price exceeded $4,000, the number of short positions also started to rise. Many market participants expected the upward momentum to weaken. A large number of these short positions were led by major hedge funds, further intensifying the downward pressure on Ethereum. This is not an isolated incident as hedge funds have been trying to suppress the ETH price in an attempt to reduce their own losses.According to The Block&apos;s &quot;CME Ether Futures Net Position&quot; dashboard, these short positions have reached a historic high. Only hedge funds s</description>

      <title>Bank of America: Stablecoin&apos;s Disruptive Application in Cross-Border P2P Payments Could Generate Up to $75 Billion in Annualized or Trigger High Demand</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25320</link>
      <description>On August 20th, according to ChainNews, a recent research report from Bank of America conducted a detailed analysis of the potential transformative influence of stablecoins in the financial system. It was pointed out that this digital asset, although facing regulatory disputes, has already shown unique advantages in areas such as cross-border transactions and retail settlements. The report clearly stated that peer-to-peer (P2P) cross-border payments are the most disruptive application scenario for stablecoins. Compared to the traditional banking system, its settlement efficiency and cost advantages are significant, making it a key channel for fund flows in emerging markets.It is worth noting that Shopify&apos;s move to allow merchants to accept USDC stablecoin has been regarded as a landmark event for retail penetration. More recently, the on-chain completion of USTs tokenized bond repurchase transactions has further highlighted institutional investors&apos; recognition of the stablecoin&apos;s set</description>

      <title>Coinbase to Provide Tiered USDC Subsidy for Unfilled Futures Positions</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25318</link>
      <description>On August 20th, according to the community host Super Jun of BlockBeats, Coinbase&apos;s derivatives product updated a new feature today. It provides a staggered USDC subsidy based on users&apos; open contract positions.Super Jun stated, &quot;This subsidy is directly comparable to funding rate products like BFUSD and USDE. For instance, if a user has a $1 million USDC collateral and opens a contract worth $2 million, then the user&apos;s $1 million USDC collateral will naturally obtain an annualized return of 8%. If a user has $10 million USDC collateral and opens a $20 million contract, then the user&apos;s $10 million USDC will receive an annualized return of 12%.&quot;</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25316</link>
      <description>On August 20th, the stock price of Michael Saylor-led Strategy (MSTR) dropped to a nearly four-month low.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin, which hit a historic high of $124,128 last Thursday, has dropped by 8.6% to $113,631. Saylor posted on social media on Monday: &quot;Strategy has announced today an update to the MSTR stock ATM (additional issuance) policy to provide greater flexibility in the execution of our capital allocation strategy.&quot; He also attached a chart showing the company&apos;s ability to issue stock at levels below the previous restrictions.The updated policy states that when MSTR&apos;s trading price is less than 2.5 times the net asset value (mNAV), the company can &quot;strategically issue MSTR&quot; to pay debt interest, fund preferred stock dividends, or opera</description>

      <title>Eugene: Long on Ethereum with a Small Position, Seeking a Short-term Opportunity in the $4400-4600 Range</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25313</link>
      <description>On August 20th, trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio shared on his personal channel: &quot;I have established a small long position at this level in Ethereum. After realizing profits at $4700, I am engaging in range trading. Currently, I am mainly focusing on seeking short-term opportunities within the $4400-$4600 range. Then, I will evaluate whether to continue searching for higher positions.&quot;It is crucial to bear in mind that my risk exposure in these trades has now become significantly lower compared to before because the risk/reward ratio (r/r) of these trades is lower (although it is still positive).</description>

      <title>Bridge Capital Founder: Holds a Significant Amount of Bitcoin, Sticks to End-of-Year Bitcoin Price Target of $180,000-$200,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25312</link>
      <description>August 20th. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and CEO of SkyBridge Capital, reiterated on Tuesday that despite the recent market correction, he still maintains his year-end price target for Bitcoin between $180,000 and $200,000. In an interview with CNBC, Anthony discussed the current situation of the Bitcoin market:“I think the market is currently experiencing a lot of consolidation at present, while institutions are continuously entering. If you had attended a similar conference three years ago, most of the attendees were retail investors and some CEOs engaged in Layer1 blockchain. But today, a greater number of attendees are institutional investors,” he said. Some large investors are selling their Bitcoin holdings, resulting in some consolidation in the market. However, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin in the medium term, citing that demand exceeds supply.Anthony himself and his SkyBridge fund hold “a significant amount of Bitcoin.” Previously, he has also stated that 70% of his</description>
