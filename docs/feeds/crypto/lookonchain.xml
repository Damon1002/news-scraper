      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the mainstream CEX&apos;s total long liquidation amount will reach $984 million</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25025</link>
      <description>On August 18th, according to Coinglass data, in the event that Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will amount to $984 million.On the other hand, if Bitcoin rises above $117,000, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach $688 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not precisely depict the number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Consequently, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it attains a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that once the price reaches that level, it will undergo a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
