      <title>ECB Executive Board Member Lane Warns: Federal Reserve Independence Being Eroded, Market Trust May Be Affected</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26671</link>
      <description>August 28: The Executive Board member of the European Central Bank and the Governor of the Bank of Finland, Rehn, warned on Thursday in a speech that for the first time in decades, the independence of the Federal Reserve is facing a &quot;major&quot; challenge, posing &quot;significant&quot; risks to the market and the economy. Rehn said: &quot;Since the containment of double-digit inflation in the 1980s, the independence of the Federal Reserve has been regarded as an inviolable principle - but now this principle is being eroded. When the central bank is trusted, the public, businesses, and financial markets all believe that it will uphold price stability. This trust anchors inflation expectations.&quot; Rehn stated that the credibility brought by independence has enhanced the effectiveness of monetary policy, meaning that the central bank does not need to make &quot;drastic&quot; responses to temporary economic fluctuations.
