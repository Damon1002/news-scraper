      <title>The high-profile Bitcoin whale who swapped ETH has sold 34,110 BTC over the past 11 days and bought 813,298.84 ETH.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27050</link>
      <description>On August 31st, according to the monitoring of @mlmabc, a highly prominent Bitcoin whale that has been rebalancing into ETH sold 7,000 BTC (approximately $7.59 billion) within the past 46 hours and purchased 171,791.84 ETH (approximately $7.73 billion). This whale still holds 3,000 BTC (about $3.25 billion) in the address beginning with 169qY, and it is likely that this will be rebalanced into ETH.Furthermore, the whale&apos;s wallet also contains 46,816 BTC (about $50.7 billion). Based on previous activities, another 14,495 BTC (about $15.7 billion) may be rebalanced into ETH. However, the remaining 32,321 BTC (about $35 billion) currently has an unknown movement. Overall, it seems that the whale intends to rebalance its entire holdings. This is mere speculation and not investment advice, and the true intentions of the whale remain unclear.As of now, in the past 11 days, the whale has sold 34,110 BTC (about $37 billion) and purchased 813,298.84 ETH (about $36.6 billion).</description>

      <title>Analysis: The WLFI TGE circulating supply is significantly lower than expected, with only 65.5% of the presale tokens transferred to the Lockbox contract for activation.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27045</link>
      <description>August 31st. According to on-chain analyst Ai (@ai_9684xtpa), currently among the total 1 trillion WLFI token supply, only 20% of the explicitly unlocked tokens at TGE come from public sale rounds one and two. The total number of tokens from public sale rounds is 250 billion.· Assuming all participants have transferred their tokens to Lockbox and activated them, then the TGE circulating supply would be 5 billion tokens (5% of the total supply). Estimated at the current Binance contract price of $0.3858, this would result in a $1.93 billion sell-off.· However, Tokenomist discovered that in the WLFI smart contract, the corresponding early presale user share is only 1.843 million tokens (with 6.57 billion tokens not included). If this situation is true, then under the same conditions, the TGE circulating supply will be reduced to 3.68 billion tokens, with approximately a $1.42 billion sell-off.· As of eight o&apos;clock tonight, the WLFI Lockbox contract has received a total of 16.395 bi</description>
