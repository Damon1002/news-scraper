      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27960</link>
      <description>September 6: The CEO of the data analytics platform CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, posted on social media, saying, &quot;I am in support of Justin on this matter.

      <title>J.P. Morgan Strategist: U.S. Economic Growth is Gradually Slowing, Does Not Believe Fed Rate Cuts Will Fuel Growth</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27957</link>
      <description>On September 6th, David Kelly, the Chief Global Strategist of JPMorgan Asset Management, stated in a recent interview with CNBC that the weak August jobs report and other economic data suggest that the weakening trend of the US economy is intensifying. &quot;Although the current economy is not in a recession, it is gradually slowing down. All data consistently show that this already stumbling economy - like a tortoise always moving slowly forward - is now almost exhausted.&quot;Kelly also believes that given the deterioration of the job market data, the Fed&apos;s expected rate cut will not be able to boost the overall economy. &quot;I see today&apos;s stock market rise, which clearly reflects the market&apos;s expectation of an imminent rate cut. However, this does not solve the fundamental problem. The government needs to realize that if they cut rates now, it will reduce the interest income of retirees while sending more rate cut signals to the market. In that case, borrowers have no reason to borrow more mone</description>

      <title>Mizuho Bank: The Fed Has Been Realistically &quot;Face-Slapped,&quot; Easing Cycle Set to Begin</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27956</link>
      <description>September 6th. Mizuho Bank declared that the U.S. August non-farm payroll report further verified the weakening tendency in the labor market. The growth in employment, working hours, and income has regressed to the levels during the pandemic period. Regardless of inflation, it is almost certain that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at the September meeting. A 25-basis-point rate cut is almost a certainty. However, if August inflation is weaker than expected, a 50-basis-point cut is more likely. The Fed&apos;s previous inflation forecasts have been &quot;slapped in the face&quot; by reality, while its 2026 unemployment rate forecast is at risk of not being achieved. They were overly pessimistic about inflation before and overly optimistic about the labor market. It is expected that the Fed will initiate a round of sustained easing cycle, aiming to lower interest rates to its perceived &quot;neutral level&quot; by March 2026, which is around 3%. The new Fed chair is likely to further increase stimulus</description>
