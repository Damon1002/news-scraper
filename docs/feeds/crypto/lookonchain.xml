      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26940</link>
      <description>August 30th: Trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio put up a post on his personal channel, indicating that he is not currently involved in market trading at present.

However, currently, the performance of Bitcoin has not lived up to the bullish expectations.Before this, on August 14th, Eugene said that he had already closed the majority of his ETH positions in order to significantly reduce the risk exposure as multiple warning signals were blinking before his eyes. On August 24th, he expressed his view that the bull market cycle is coming to an end, and his personal ETH trading has completely stopped.</description>
