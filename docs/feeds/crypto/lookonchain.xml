It is currently testing the endpoint of the triangle formed by the descending trendline and horizontal support. The range of 118,500â€“118,800 serves as short-term resistance, and 116,300 is strong support.

      <title>Trump&apos;s Equivalent Tariffs Effective Date Postponed by One Week to August 7th</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22732</link>
      <description>On Thursday night local time on August 1st, US President Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging from 15% to 41% on goods exported to the United States from 67 trading partners, raising the tariff level to the highest in over a century. Nevertheless, the new tariffs will not come into effect until August 7th instead of the originally scheduled August 1st, providing other countries with another opportunity to attempt to negotiate for lower tariffs. A senior government official stated, &quot;This is of historical significance; this is a new trading system. This is what I refer to as the Trump Round of Negotiations.&quot; White House officials said on Thursday night that they hope to reach more agreements with other countries prior to the new tariff implementation date of August 7th.
