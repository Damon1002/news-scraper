      <title>The Succinct Prover Network has been officially deployed on the mainnet, enabling the native token PROVE.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23293</link>

It enables various applications to submit zero-knowledge proof (ZK proof) requests, which are then competitively verified by independent provers. The goal is to allow developers to use zero-knowledge technology without the need for custom configurations, facilitating the construction of secure, transparent, and scalable cryptographic infrastructure.This system will support various platforms. Ethereum has already identified ZK technology as a key focus for its future development. Additionally, the system also supports high-speed rollups, which are suitable for handling computationally intensive applications processing tens of thousands of transactions per second, such as trading platforms and AI agents.The network&apos;s architecture adopts a design of off-chain execution and on-chain settlement, similar to Layer 2 solutions. Proofs are periodically submitted to Ethereum, allowing</description>
