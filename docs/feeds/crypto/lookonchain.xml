      <title>CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Profit Taken Reached a Bottom Lower Than Before, Accumulation Trend Dominates Market</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24732</link>
      <description>On August 15th, the CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. posted a message indicating that the cumulative distribution of long-term holders who have held Bitcoin for six months to two years shows that the supply they hold has increased from 3.551 million BTC in April (when the Bitcoin price was $83,000) to the current 5.191 million BTC, with a growth of 1.64 million BTC. During the test at the all-time high (ATH) of $118,000, there was a moderate profit-taking, and the 7-day average outflow of long-term holders rose to 20,000 BTC, which is significantly lower than the past typical outflow peaks (40,000 to 70,000 BTC). Overall, this suggests that in the current market, the Bitcoin accumulation trend is more dominant compared to profit distribution.</description>
