      <title>Fed Speak: Market Focus Shifts to Second Rate Cut This Year, Aggressive Easing Still Stalled by Inflation</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25993</link>
      <description>On August 24th, Nick Timiraos, a renowned reporter from The Wall Street Journal and often dubbed the &quot;Fed Whisperer,&quot; released a new article titled &quot;Powell&apos;s Rate Cut Signal Reflects Delicate Economic Situation.&quot; The article stated that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is cautiously laying the groundwork for a rate cut next month. However, he has sent a subtle message to those anticipating aggressive easing, indicating that they should not expect a drastic move. The market has largely factored in a September rate cut, and the focus has now shifted to whether the Fed will consider another rate cut during the last two meetings of the year (October and December).Powell&apos;s cautious stance reflects the complex economic dynamics facing the Fed. He described the labor market as showing &quot;peculiar&quot; signs of softness despite a low unemployment rate. Meanwhile, price increases driven by tariffs are beginning to impact the economy. Powell largely adopted the rate-cut argument put forward by Fe</description>

      <title>Security Alert: Beware of EIP-7702 Phishing Batch Transaction Trap</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25990</link>
      <description>On August 24th, Cao Yun, the founder of SlowMist, retweeted a security alert posted by ScamSniffer. It was indicated that today, another user lost approximately $1.54 million due to signing an EIP-7702 phishing batch transaction, involving ETH, BTC, and multiple tokens staked on Ethereum. The principle of EIP-7702 is to delegate the authorization of the user&apos;s EOA address to MetaMask: EIP-7702 Delegator, and to complete subsequent token transfer operations through its contract call. This phishing method has been industrialized by mainstream phishing groups. If one is inadvertently induced to make transactions, the entire account assets will be lost. Users are reminded to verify the authenticity of the website and links before confirming transactions to prevent fraud.Earlier on August 22nd, according to ScamSniffer&apos;s monitoring, a user signed a phishing batch EIP-7702 transaction disguised as a Uniswap swap trade and lost approximately $1 million in tokens and NFTs. The attacker disgu</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25989</link>
      <description>On August 24th, based on GMGN data, the price of the GEN token exceeded its previous high and briefly soared to $0.06040. Currently, its market value exceeded 60 million US dollars.It is reported that GEN is the native token of the General Impressions (GI) project. GI is constructing the core infrastructure of the Agentic AI era, which is a Rust-driven intelligent body network providing underlying support for the trusted execution of autonomous AI, low-cost reusability, and multi-agent collaboration. As a key driver of the rise of the Agentic Paradigm, GI is gradually becoming a key algorithmic protocol for decentralized intelligent systems.BlockBeats reminds users that meme coins often lack practical use cases and experience significant price volatility. Therefore, investments should be made with caution.</description>

      <title>Data: Whenever the cumulative rate cut reaches 2%, the S&amp;P 500 tends to rise by an average of 13.9%.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25988</link>
      <description>On August 24th, analysts claim that the U.S. labor market is deteriorating at a rapid pace. The latest data has revised down a whopping -258,000 job positions for May and June alone. This number is even greater than the total population of Scottsdale, Arizona. Up to now this year, 461,000 U.S. job positions have been revised downwards, and many leading indicators of the labor market are collapsing.All of this indicates that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in order to curb inflation. However, as inflation rebounds, those without assets will find themselves in a situation similar to that in the post-pandemic era. Wage growth will lag behind inflation, and the wealth gap will widen. When the Fed has lowered rates to within 2% historically, as has occurred in the past 20 times, the S&amp;P 500 index has on average seen a +13.9% increase over the next 12 months, and asset owners will be in a party mood just like they were in 2021.</description>

      <title>Analysis: Powell has effectively caved, September rate cut a &apos;done deal&apos;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25986</link>
      <description>August 24th. The Kobeissi Letter disclosed its most recent market analysis, indicating that Fed Chair Powell has essentially yielded. The Fed is scheduled to cut rates one month from now, attributing it to the &quot;weak labor market.&quot; Meanwhile, the PPI inflation rate has reached its highest level in 3 years, and the CPI inflation rate has remained above 2% for 53 consecutive months. At this moment, not holding assets will lag behind the market.To gain a better understanding of what is transpiring, it is necessary to initially comprehend the Fed&apos;s responsibilities: The Fed&apos;s objective is to reduce unemployment and prevent inflation/deflation, which constitutes the Fed&apos;s &quot;dual mandate.&quot; Since 2021, the Fed has been extremely attentive to inflation. However, Fed Chair Powell&apos;s Friday speech brought about a significant transformation: &quot;A change in the balance of risks might necessitate a readjustment of our policy stance.&quot; In other words, the Fed now deems the risk of unemployment to be gre</description>
