      <title>Analysis: The European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged tonight, and the market reaction is likely to be relatively muted</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21656</link>
      <description>On July 24th, a strategist at TD Securities anticipates that the European Central Bank will maintain the deposit rate at 2.00% this evening. It is suggested that since this meeting may not indicate new policy actions, the market reaction might be relatively mild. The strategist holds the view that the ECB may need to both highlight the resilience of the Eurozone economy and mention the &quot;extremely severe global uncertainty.&quot; The ECB is expected to continue its policy approach of being &quot;data-dependent and making gradual meeting decisions.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
