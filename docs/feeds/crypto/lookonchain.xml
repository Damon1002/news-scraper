      <title>Federal Reserve&apos;s Daly: Rate Cut Timing Is Near, More Likely to Cut Rates Over Twice This Year</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23140</link>
      <description>On August 5th, San Francisco Fed President Daly stated that with the growing evidence of a weak job market and the absence of signs of tariff-driven inflation persisting, the moment for a rate cut is getting closer. When discussing the Fed&apos;s decision from last week, Daly said, &quot;I&apos;m willing to wait for another cycle, but I can&apos;t wait indefinitely.&quot;Although this does not mean that a rate cut in September is a certainty, she said, &quot;I would be inclined to the view that each meeting moving forward is a possible meeting for a policy adjustment.&quot; Daly stated that two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year still seem to be an appropriate recalibration. The key lies in whether to cut in both September and December rather than whether the cut will occur.Daly said, &quot;If inflation picks up and spreads, or if the labor market heats up, of course, we could have fewer than two cuts. But more likely, we would need to cut more than twice. If the labor market appears to be moving into a soft phase and we</description>

      <title>Fed&apos;s Daly: Two Interest Rate Cuts This Year Still Appropriate Adjustment Level, No Sign of Prolonged Tariff Impact on Inflation</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23139</link>
      <description>On August 5th, Federal Reserve&apos;s Daly indicated that it remains appropriate to make two rate cuts this year. She was content with the Fed&apos;s July decision but less so with making the same decision again.There remains a great deal of uncertainty regarding whether a rate cut will occur in September. &quot;Regarding the July decision, I would be willing to wait for another cycle, but we cannot wait indefinitely. The labor market is not significantly weak, but it is showing signs of softening, and further softening would be undesirable.&quot;No signs have been detected of tariffs having a persistent impact on inflation.

      <title>CZ: The Cryptocurrency Global Race is expected to arrive soon. Countries that delay adoption will be forced to buy in at a higher price.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23136</link>
      <description>On August 5th, CZ said in an interview: &quot;The world&apos;s largest economy is establishing a crypto reserve. This implies that for any country that is not currently doing so, when they do start, they will be at a considerable disadvantage. Since the wealthiest countries have already aggressively purchased Bitcoin, the next country that buys them will only be able to do so at a higher price. As a result, they will be able to buy less with the same amount of money. I believe we will witness a competition among countries in adopting Bitcoin and mainstream cryptocurrencies.&quot;</description>
