      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Shows No Clear Signs of &quot;Overheating&quot; Yet, Current Main Risk is a Normal Pullback</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24539</link>
      <description>On August 14th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. posted that although Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, the Bitcoin Price Temperature (BPT) still remained at a moderately high level of 2.56 (below the local peak of 3.57). This shows that the current cycle is in the &quot;warm&quot; range but has not yet shown significant signs of overheating. The price is maintaining above the four-year moving average and its +2Ïƒ, confirming a bullish trend.The main risk is a normal pullback in the uptrend, and the &quot;endgame&quot; signal will appear when BPT accelerates above 3.0.</description>

      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $120,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation volume will reach $1.569 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24538</link>
      <description>On August 14th, Bitcoin continued to decline in the afternoon. It is currently priced at $121,625, with a 1.44% drop occurring in nearly 4 hours.According to Coinglass data, if Bitcoin falls below $120,000, the cumulative long liquidation strength of mainstream CEXs will reach $1.569 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin rises above $123,000, the cumulative short liquidation strength of mainstream CEXs will reach $977 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, strength.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows the extent to which the underlying price will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will have a more intense reaction due to a surge in liquidity.</description>

      <title>Placeholder Partner: October Market Cap or Peak, Ethereum sees $6900, SOL sees $420</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24536</link>
      <description>On August 14th, Chris Burniske, who was formerly the lead of Ark Invest&apos;s crypto and is now a partner at Placeholder VC, predicted the following peak prices for major cryptocurrencies in October: Bitcoin: $142,690; Ethereum: $6,900 - $8,000; SOL: $420. Chris Burniske also noted that the crazier the prices in August, September, and October are, the more convinced he is that October will be the top. If the market can experience a sharp correction soon and remain relatively calm, perhaps this bull run could last even longer.</description>
