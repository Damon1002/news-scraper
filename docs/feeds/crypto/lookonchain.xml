      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation volume will reach $944 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23216</link>
      <description>On August 5th, according to Coinglass data, in the event that Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the cumulative intensity of long liquidation on mainstream CEXs will reach $944 million.On the other hand, if Bitcoin rebounds above $115,000, the cumulative intensity of short liquidation on mainstream CEXs will reach $77.28 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, which is referred to as intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent reaching a certain price level will have an impact. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that once the price reaches that level, a more intense reaction will occur due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

According to GMGN data, within the past 6 hours on the Solana blockchain in the &quot;Next Blue Chip&quot; sector, the top five tokens in terms of market capitalization are PUMP, MarsMi, DUMP, Ani, and Bucky. Here, DUMP has been listed for less than 24 hours. It has a low trading volume and either has fewer than a thousand holding addresses or poses significant risks.On the other hand, on the Base chain, in the past 24 hours, the top five tokens by trading volume released on Clanker are BNKR, CLANKER, Fartcoin, NET, and QR. The latter two are newly on the list and have been performing exceptionally well these days.BlockBeats reminds users that Meme coins often lack practical use cases and experience significant price volatility.

      <title>Opinion: Ethereum ETF Sees Record Single-Day Net Outflow, Signaling Short-Term Profit Taking, Not Institutional Waning</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23210</link>
      <description>August 5th. In relation to yesterday&apos;s largest single-day net outflow of a U.S. Ethereum spot ETF, Nick Ruck, the research director of LVRG, stated: &quot;Although this might suggest profit-taking following ETH&apos;s recent price surge, it does not necessarily imply a decline in institutional demand. Particularly when considering the industry&apos;s record $5.4 billion inflow in July and the corporate accumulation of ETH.&quot;Vincent Liu, the chief information officer of Kronos Research, also holds a similar view. &quot;This trend reflects short-term profit-taking and the fluctuation of risk aversion sentiment rather than a rejection of long-term ETH holdings.&quot; (The Block)</description>

      <title>HTX DeepThink: Fed&apos;s Unwillingness to Provide Clear Guidance on Easing Triggers Short-Term Market Shock, &quot;Collapse&quot; in Employment Data Prompts Reassessment of Rate Cut Expectations</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23209</link>
      <description>On August 5th, HTX DeepThink columnist and HTX Research researcher Chloe (@ChloeTalk1) pointed out in her analysis that during the July FOMC meeting, the interest rate was kept at 5.25%–5.50% and no guidance was provided on future interest rate cuts, which triggered market concerns about &quot;sustaining high interest rates for a longer period.&quot; Subsequently, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield rose to 4.24%, the U.S. dollar index returned above 100, gold fell below $3,270, and Bitcoin retraced to the $116,000 range in the short term. Meanwhile, on-chain activity also decreased synchronously.The July non-farm payroll report unexpectedly saw a &quot;cliff-like decline&quot;: only 73,000 new jobs were added, falling short of the expected 180,000. Moreover, the employment data for May and June were revised downward by about 90% in total. The reality of a &quot;systemic overestimation&quot; of the labor market promptly led the market to quickly reassess the Fed&apos;s policy path. As a result, the CME FedWatch inter</description>
