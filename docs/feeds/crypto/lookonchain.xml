      <title>Viewpoint: Inflation Data Intensifies Market Bearish Sentiment, Bitcoin&apos;s Key Psychological Support Level at $100,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27135</link>
      <description>On September 1st, Vincent Liu, the CIO of Kronos Research, stated that the inflation data has intensified the bearish market sentiment. This sentiment initially emerged after a series of large-scale Bitcoin whale sell-offs triggered the liquidation of leveraged positions.Vincent Liu believes: &quot;The key psychological support level of Bitcoin is at $100,000. With leveraged positions under pressure, it highlights the fragility of its liquidity.&quot; He also added that the key support level of Ethereum is at $4,000. &quot;If these support levels are breached, it could trigger further declines and more widespread liquidity tightening. However, a true bear market requires a more sustained decline.&quot;Regarding this week&apos;s non-farm payroll data, Vincent Liu stated, &quot;A significant surprise in job growth could trigger sharp market volatility. Strong data could pressure the cryptocurrency as risk appetite wanes, while weaker-than-expected data could boost demand.&quot; (The Block)</description>
