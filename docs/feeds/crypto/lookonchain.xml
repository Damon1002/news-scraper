      <description>On August 4th, according to Coinglass data, the current funding rates of mainstream CEX and DEX show a divergent market trend, with both bearish and neutral sentiments. The specific funding rates for mainstream coins are shown in the attached image.BlockBeats Note: The funding rate is a fee set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price. It is usually applicable to perpetual contracts and is a mechanism for the exchange of funds between long and short traders. The trading platform does not charge this fee. It is used to adjust the cost or profit of traders holding contracts to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.When the funding rate is 0.01%, it represents the baseline rate. When the funding rate is greater than 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market. When the funding rate is less than 0.005%, it signifies a generally bearish market.</description>

      <title>Analyst: Rate Cut Expectation Heating Up in Tandem with SEC&apos;s New Policy, Market Sentiment Improving</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23049</link>
      <description>On August 4th, according to The Block, Vincent Liu, the Chief Investment Officer of Kronos Research, stated that in the midst of macroeconomic uncertainty and institutional buying, the current market is demonstrating a sense of &quot;cautious optimism.&quot; The Fear and Greed Index is moving towards &quot;greed,&quot; and whale accumulation and expectations of rate cuts are driving traders to reallocate risk assets.Investors are focusing on the U.S. July CPI data, which will be released on August 12th, as a key indicator for the next interest rate hike or cut decision. Although the Fed maintained rates at the July FOMC meeting and Powell stated that a September rate cut still depends on economic data, CME FedWatch data shows that the market expects a probability of more than 80% for a 0.25 percentage point cut.Furthermore, Liu believes that the U.S. SEC&apos;s &quot;Project Crypto&quot; could be beneficial to the market in the medium to long term. This project will reduce regulatory uncertainty, promote the growth</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23046</link>
      <description>August 4th. As per the Financial Times, the former UK Chancellor George Osborne launched a vehement assault on the Labour government&apos;s stance towards cryptocurrency. He cautioned that the UK might miss out on a &quot;financial revolution analogous to that of the 1980s&quot; and lag behind the trend.Osborne is currently a member of the Global Advisory Board of the US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. He stated that Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey are placing the UK on the slower track. Osborne said, &quot;Rachel Reeves is correct. We have all become overly risk-averse. We became the world&apos;s financial center because we were not afraid of change. The harsh truth is that, just like many other aspects, we are completely behind in cryptocurrency and stablecoins. It is time to catch up.&quot;Osborne asserted that blaming regulators for being overly cautious is an &quot;unsustainable excuse.&quot; Reeves should take the lead from the US Congress and establish a legal framework for cryp</description>
