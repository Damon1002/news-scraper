      <title>If Ethereum surpasses $4550, the mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation pressure will reach $1.173 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27066</link>
      <description>On September 1st, according to Coinglass data, in the event that Ethereum breaks through $4550, the total short liquidation strength of mainstream CEX will amount to 1.173 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum drops below $4400, the total long liquidation strength of mainstream CEX will reach 1.012 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the precise value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent clusters, that is, the strength.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the target price will be influenced when it reaches a certain position. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that when the price reaches that point, it will experience a more intense response due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
