      <title>Bitunix Analyst: WLFI Experiences Massive Volume on First Day of Trading, Followed by Retracement; High Risk of Politicized Token Issuance; Heatmap Indicates Support Level at $0.22 and Resistance L...</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27280</link>
      <description>September 2nd: On Monday, September 2nd, WLFI went live and set off a trading frenzy. In just one hour, the trading volume exceeded $1 billion. After opening, the price soared to nearly the $0.40 range and then sharply dropped back to around $0.20 - $0.25 before rebounding.
