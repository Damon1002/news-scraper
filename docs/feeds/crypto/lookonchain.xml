      <title>Nearly 600 Economists Call for Defending Federal Reserve Independence, Co-sign Open Letter in Support of Powell</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27400</link>
      <description>September 2nd: After U.S. President Trump attempted to dismiss Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook due to suspicion of mortgage fraud, a significant number of prominent economists have expressed support for her. Nearly 600 economists have signed an open letter in favor of Cook, indicating that the bar for removing a Federal Reserve Board member is extremely high, and elected officials should refrain from taking actions that undermine the Fed&apos;s independence. The open letter was released on Tuesday and its signatories encompass Nobel laureates Claudia Goldin and Paul Romer, the former chair of the Obama administration&apos;s Council of Economic Advisers Christina Romer, as well as Ohio State University professor Trevon Logan, who co-authored a paper with Cook.
