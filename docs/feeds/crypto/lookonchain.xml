      <title>Bitcoin Order Book Imbalance Hits New Low Since May 2018, If the Trend Continues, It May Lead to a Significant Market Correction</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26470</link>
      <description>On August 27th, the cryptocurrency market analysis firm CryptoOnchain posted on social media that the 30-day moving average of Bitcoin&apos;s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has fallen to the lowest level since May 2018, which is even lower than the bear market bottom in November 2021. This shows that with the weakening of the buying momentum, the market is facing significant selling pressure, suggesting a potential short-term price decline. Although Bitcoin&apos;s price has risen, the continuous downward trend of this ratio indicates that the growth is not sustainable. If this trend continues, we may witness a significant market correction or a prolonged downward trend in prices.</description>

      <title>Matrixport: Ethereum&apos;s Price Momentum Weakens, Future Trend Depends on Treasury Buy Pressure and Market Narrative</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26469</link>
      <description>On August 27th, Matrixport issued its latest report on social media, indicating that the current market focus continues to revolve around Ethereum and Ethereum treasury concept companies. Ethereum&apos;s current upward trend remains unbroken and has obtained support at the moving average line. The dip-buying strategy in mid-August has demonstrated its effectiveness.Analyst Markus Thielen stated that Ethereum&apos;s upward momentum is waning; it is anticipated to range between $4,355 and $4,958, with a high possibility of retesting the $4,355 support level. The subsequent trend will mainly depend on the fundraising ability of Ethereum treasury concept companies and the market narrative they convey.This still constitutes the core theme of the crypto market - respecting technical analysis may perhaps be the decisive factor between profit and loss.</description>

      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Metrics Show Current Stage More Likely a Bull Market Pause Than Cycle End</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26468</link>
      <description>On August 27th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel posted on social media that the current Bitcoin&apos;s annualized adjusted MVRV ratio has entered the 1.0 range. This implies that the short-term average (30 days) is approximately in line with the annual average (365 days). The annualized basis remains positive, and its curve shows a horizontal trend. This is due to the offsetting effects of two factors: after a strong rally, the 30-day metric is cooling in tandem with volatility and the speed of profit-taking. Meanwhile, the significant 365-day average still incorporates the growth momentum of the past few months. As a result, the numerator and denominator move almost in unison, narrowing the difference between the two. The basis line neither descends nor accelerates upward, indicating that the market is largely digesting the earlier gains.This situation is more inclined towards a pause in the bull market structure rather than the end of the cycle. As long as the annualized basis does not show a</description>

      <title>Solayer introduces the cross-chain bridge sBridge, supporting the connection of Solana to InfiniSVM and other SVM chains</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26465</link>
      <description>On August 27th, the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Solayer declared the initiation of a cross-chain bridge named sBridge featuring a dedicated SVM semantics. Both SOON and Sonic have provided support for sBridge. sBridge directly links Solana to InfiniSVM and other SVM chains, facilitating seamless real-time liquidity and asset transfers without the necessity of going through EVM detours.In contrast to existing multi-chain solutions, sBridge is specifically optimized for the SVM chain, eliminating the conversion layer. This cross-chain bridge offers native PDA proof and hardware-accelerated ED25519 signatures, enabling the transfer of data and value at the actual speed of the SVM.</description>
