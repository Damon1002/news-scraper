      <title>Analysis: Bitcoin Slightly Above Key Monthly Bull Market Support Level, Market in Recovery Phase</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27659</link>
      <description>On September 4th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. made a post stating that any form of recovery might have the potential to drive the Bitcoin price back above $113,000 and move towards the fair range of the 30-day moving average. The recent bullish scenario involves a technical rebound reaching the $113,000 to $115,000 range, and the on-chain flows are also trending towards stability. The current Bitcoin price of $110,700 is slightly higher than the realized price of Short-Term Holders (STH), which is $107,600 (a crucial monthly bull market support level). It remains bullish on a higher time frame but the market is in a recuperative phase and is sensitive to profit-taking.</description>
