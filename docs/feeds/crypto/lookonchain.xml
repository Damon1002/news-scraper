      <title>Analysis: After the sale by the &quot;Ancient Whale&quot; of 80,000 BTC, 97% of the circulating supply is still in a profitable position</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22423</link>
      <description>On July 30th, glassnode released an analysis article about the &quot;80,000 BTC Ancient Whale&quot; sell-off that took place last weekend. It was pointed out that although the sell-side volume reached as high as $9.6 billion, the market effectively absorbed the selling pressure. As a result, the price dropped to $115,000 and then stabilized briefly at $119,000, which is slightly below the all-time high.The analysis stated that even after this large-scale distribution event, the unrealized profit held by market participants is still substantial. Currently, the accrued on-chain profit exceeds $1.4 trillion, and 97% of the circulating supply is still in profit.According to multiple on-chain valuation models, the Bitcoin price is still fluctuating between $105,000 and $125,000. If it decisively breaks out of this range, it may trigger a rally to $141,000. Considering the high expected unrealized profit at this price level, the selling pressure may further intensify in this area.</description>

      <title>Opinion: Aggressive Rate Cut Could Damage Fed&apos;s Credibility, This Meeting Expected to Reaffirm Patience</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22424</link>
      <description>On July 30th, Benoit Anne, the Managing Director of MFS Investment Management, stated that the Federal Reserve is currently in a lagging position. &quot;We all hold the view that there will be more rate cuts in the future, but it is still uncertain when exactly they will commence,&quot; he said. He pointed out that the ongoing dispute regarding political intervention and the Fed&apos;s independence has caused significant disruptions to the decision-making environment. He cautioned that &quot;if the Fed were to suddenly adopt aggressive rate-cutting measures in the coming months, it could pose a certain reputational risk.&quot; In view of this, it is anticipated that the Fed will emphasize its &quot;patience&quot; stance at the FOMC meeting and reaffirm its cautious decision-making approach.

      <title>Viewpoint: The development of stablecoins in Hong Kong should be anchored to real-world use cases such as cross-border trade.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22422</link>
      <description>July 30th: The &quot;Stablecoin Regulation&quot; in Hong Kong is set to come into effect officially on August 1, 2025. Song Min, the Dean of the China-Central Institute for Regional Economic Development at Wuhan University, pointed out that the emergence of stablecoins is an inevitable outcome of technological progress. However, technology cannot replace regulation. China should seize the opportunity to establish a regulatory framework and follow a path of &quot;institution-led, scenario-based implementation, and gradual progress.&quot;Hong Kong&apos;s stablecoin will be applicable in areas such as cross-border trade settlement and the integration of on-chain Real World Asset (RWA), which will boost the real economy. Hong Kong plays an irreplaceable strategic role in the internationalization of the RMB, with the most significant breakthrough in cross-border trade settlement. More RMB-denominated financial products need to be introduced. (NBD News)</description>
