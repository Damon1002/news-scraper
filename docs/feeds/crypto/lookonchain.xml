      <title>Justin Sun: No Reason to Doubt High-Yield Staking, Interest Subsidized by Corporate Profits</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27680</link>
      <description>On September 4th, Justin Sun responded to the inquiries regarding the &quot;Huobi HTX High-Yield Financial Product&quot; as follows:Similar to the popular instant rewards (free lunch) in the current industry, the high-yield interest rate is 100% subsidized by the group. This is essentially done to compete for users among trading platforms. The subsidy logic is also very straightforward: user growth leads to trading volume growth, which is worthwhile in the long run.Huobi HTX is still in the early stage of growth and will consider other factors after increasing asset immersion.The Merkel Tree proof has been released for nearly 34 months, ensuring fund transparency.The current group has an annual profit of tens of billions of US dollars. Therefore, no one should question our ability to subsidize, right?Finally, Justin Sun stated that there is no reason to question the Huobi HTX demand deposit financial product as funds can be withdrawn directly.</description>
