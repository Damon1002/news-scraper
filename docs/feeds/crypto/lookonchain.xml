      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21707</link>
      <description>On July 24th, the native USDC was officially launched on the Sei network with CCTP V2. Circle Mint provides full support for native USDC on Sei, enabling institutional users to access USDC liquidity through Sei&apos;s high-performance infrastructure. By leveraging Sei&apos;s high-performance architecture, over 13-chain cross-chain stablecoin transfers can be achieved without bridging and slippage.The old version Sei USDC.n can still be used, and its users will gradually migrate to the new version of Sei native USDC. Sei is accelerating its pace to become a core infrastructure for cross-chain finance. The native USDC has brought institutional-grade financial infrastructure to Sei. Unlike cross-chain bridged tokens with counterparty risks and usage friction, Sei&apos;s native USDC is directly issued by Circle on Sei, providing developers with the trust and capital efficiency they need.</description>

      <description>On July 24th, last week in the United States, the number of initial jobless claims unexpectedly dropped, suggesting a stable labor market situation. Nevertheless, the slowdown in hiring has made it harder for many laid-off workers to obtain new job opportunities. The data released by the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday indicated that for the week ending July 19th, the seasonally adjusted initial unemployment claims decreased by 4,000 to 217,000, which was lower than expected. This data has shown a retreat since the initial claims reached an eight-month high in early June.The report also revealed that for the week ending July 12th, the seasonally adjusted continued claims increased by 4,000 to 1.955 million. Goldman Sachs economist Elsie Peng wrote in the report: &quot;Looking ahead, we anticipate that the &apos;stabilization threshold&apos; of employment growth—the monthly net job additions required to maintain a stable unemployment rate—will gradually decrease from the current estimated 90,00</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21700</link>
      <description>July 24th - On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) maintained its key interest rate at 2%. It was waiting for clearer indications regarding the direction of EU-US trade relations. Current inflation has dropped back to the 2% target level, and the rate has been reduced from 4% to 2% since June of last year. The policy pressure on the ECB has significantly eased. The ECB stated that it would continue to adhere to a &quot;meeting-by-meeting&quot; policy without predefined interest rate paths, with all decisions based on the latest data.The statement suggested that the latest information generally aligns with previous judgments on the inflation outlook.
