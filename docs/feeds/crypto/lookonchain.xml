      <title>Franklin Templeton CEO: Crypto Investment Should Focus on Infrastructure Rather Than Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25260</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Jenny Johnson, the CEO of Franklin Templeton with $1.6 trillion in assets under management, stated at the SALT Conference held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that Bitcoin is a &quot;Fear Currency.&quot; In her opinion, Bitcoin has diverted people&apos;s attention away from the genuine potential of blockchain.She holds the view that the most promising investment direction within the crypto space is blockchain infrastructure, encompassing blockchain networks, consumer applications, and node validators. Johnson anticipates that in the future, mutual funds and ETFs will gradually operate on the blockchain. However, regulatory risk still poses the greatest obstacle to this transformation. She emphasized that for active investment managers, the transparency brought by validators could bring about a &quot;game-changing&quot; impact. (CoinDesk)</description>

      <title>The US banking regulatory agency will proceed to address state-specific stablecoin regulatory frameworks</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25259</link>
      <description>August 20: The U.S. Stablecoin Certification Review Board will make a determination regarding whether each state&apos;s framework is &quot;substantially similar&quot; to the federal stablecoin issuance system. Under the leadership of the Secretary of the Treasury, the board&apos;s members comprise the Federal Reserve Chair and the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). These members must reach a consensus in order to enable state jurisdictions to obtain federal approval for stablecoin regulation. The &quot;GENIUS Act&quot; is intended to simplify state-level regulation. Gavin Meyers, the Financial Services Regulation Partner at Pierson Ferdinand LLP, stated that this act is anticipated to reduce the regulatory fragmentation among states. (Bloomberg)</description>

      <title>The crypto market continues to experience a bearish trend this morning, with Ethereum struggling to hold above $4,100 and Bitcoin dropping below $113,000.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25258</link>
      <description>On August 20th, based on HTX market data, from last night to this morning, the crypto market continued to show a bearish trend. Specifically, Ethereum dropped to approximately $4100 and is currently priced at $4107.89, with a 24-hour decline of 2.02%. Bitcoin fell below $113,000 and is currently priced at $112,895.92, with a 24-hour decline of 0.78%. On the news front, the main bearish factors may stem from the decline in the US stock market and international macroeconomic uncertainties: the US stock market closed on Tuesday, with the Dow showing a slight increase, the S&amp;P 500 down by 0.58%, and the Nasdaq down by 1.46%. The Russia-Ukraine conflict escalated once again, and the market anticipates that Powell&apos;s speech may potentially shatter the expectations of a 50 basis point rate cut.</description>
