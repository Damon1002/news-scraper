      <title>0xSun: Long ETH and Short Shitcoin Hedge Strategy currently has an overall profit of about 16%, although the price increase is not as high as ETH, the risk is lower.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24366</link>
      <description>August 13th, Smart Money, the crypto KOL 0xSun (@0xSunNFT) stated that on August 1st, the Ethereum price was approximately $3700, and it has now risen to $4660, representing a 26% increase. The short positions in altcoins witnessed a concentrated growth of 5% to 15%, with an overall profit margin of around 16%. In contrast to naked long Ethereum, a hedging strategy exerts less psychological pressure in the face of a downturn. Especially considering that Ethereum had dropped to $3360, where naked long positions might have been liquidated. However, during hedging, altcoins typically experience greater declines than Ethereum, yet the overall profit can still be enhanced, providing a better holding experience.Previously reported on August 1st, 0xSun mentioned that the current market sentiment is highly polarized between longs and shorts. He has personally initiated a hedging trade (long ETH and short a basket of altcoins), with a position ratio of approximately 1:1, believing that instit</description>

      <description>On August 13th, the Eden Network put out an announcement saying, &quot;Archer DAO was established in 2020 with the goal of creating a novel revenue source for Ethereum miners by seizing MEV (Miner Extractable Value) profits.

      <title>odin.fun Co-founder: Company Funds Insufficient to Cover Loss, Remaining Funds on Platform Safe</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24363</link>
      <description>On August 13th, a co-founder of odin.fun posted on the X Platform in response to the previously stolen funds, stating, &quot;We discovered a significant vulnerability in our latest liquidity AMM (Automated Market Maker) update. Some malicious users (mainly related to criminal gangs in China) took advantage of this vulnerability to steal a large quantity of BTC from the platform. We are still in the process of assessing the specific amount of BTC lost, and the company&apos;s funds are not enough to cover the loss. The remaining funds on the platform are in a safe state. We have identified several groups that benefited from exploiting this vulnerability and will pursue them and file lawsuits (especially considering the amount of evidence we have, including the activities in their wallets).&quot;Earlier reports suggested that the odin.fun platform had a suspected vulnerability, resulting in approximately 58.2 BTC being transferred out.</description>
