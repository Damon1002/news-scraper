      <description>August 15: The People&apos;s Bank of China issued the China Monetary Policy Implementation Report for the second quarter of 2025.

Regarding promoting a reasonable rise in prices, it is regarded as an important factor in guiding monetary policy and driving prices to remain at a reasonable level. (FX678)</description>

If this milestone is achieved, it will fundamentally establish Bitcoin&apos;s position in the US financial landscape. The market value of Strategy exceeds $100 billion, already surpassing the market capitalization threshold of the S&amp;P 500. However, the inclusion criteria for the S&amp;P 500 are not only based on market capitalization but also require the company to be registered in the US, listed on a major exchange, and to have been profitable in the past quarter and year.
