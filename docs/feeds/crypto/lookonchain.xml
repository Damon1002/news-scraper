      <title>WLFI&apos;s initial circulating supply on CoinMarketCap is shown as 27.3 billion tokens, significantly higher than the estimated 5 billion circulating tokens.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27117</link>
      <description>On September 1st, according to on-chain analyst Ai Auntie (@ai_9684xtpa), the data from CoinMarketCap shows that the verified initial circulating supply of WLFI TGE is 27.3 billion tokens. This figure is significantly higher than the previously estimated theoretical circulation of 5 billion tokens. Based on the current contract price of $0.3599, the opening sell pressure would amount to $9.83 billion.Ai Auntie pointed out that CoinMarketCap&apos;s algorithm calculates by subtracting the team/advisor/partner/Lockbox tokens from the total token supply, indicating that all strategic round tokens are regarded as circulating, which appears to be inaccurate. CoinMarketCap has not provided a response to this matter yet.</description>
