      <title>Eugene: Long on Ethereum with a Small Position, Seeking a Short-term Opportunity in the $4400-4600 Range</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25313</link>
      <description>On August 20th, trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio shared on his personal channel: &quot;I have established a small long position at this level in Ethereum. After realizing profits at $4700, I am engaging in range trading. Currently, I am mainly focusing on seeking short-term opportunities within the $4400-$4600 range. Then, I will evaluate whether to continue searching for higher positions.&quot;It is crucial to bear in mind that my risk exposure in these trades has now become significantly lower compared to before because the risk/reward ratio (r/r) of these trades is lower (although it is still positive).</description>

      <title>Bridge Capital Founder: Holds a Significant Amount of Bitcoin, Sticks to End-of-Year Bitcoin Price Target of $180,000-$200,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25312</link>
      <description>August 20th. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and CEO of SkyBridge Capital, reiterated on Tuesday that despite the recent market correction, he still maintains his year-end price target for Bitcoin between $180,000 and $200,000. In an interview with CNBC, Anthony discussed the current situation of the Bitcoin market:“I think the market is currently experiencing a lot of consolidation at present, while institutions are continuously entering. If you had attended a similar conference three years ago, most of the attendees were retail investors and some CEOs engaged in Layer1 blockchain. But today, a greater number of attendees are institutional investors,” he said. Some large investors are selling their Bitcoin holdings, resulting in some consolidation in the market. However, he remains optimistic about Bitcoin in the medium term, citing that demand exceeds supply.Anthony himself and his SkyBridge fund hold “a significant amount of Bitcoin.” Previously, he has also stated that 70% of his</description>

      <title>If Ethereum breaks $4300, the total short liquidation on mainstream CEX will reach $2.411 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25311</link>
      <description>On August 20th, based on Coinglass data, if Ethereum breaks through $4300, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on major CEXs will amount to $2.411 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum drops below $4000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on major CEXs will reach $1.314 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not disclose the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the precise value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the target price will be influenced when it reaches a specific level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that once the price reaches that level, it will undergo a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
