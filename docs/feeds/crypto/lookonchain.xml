      <title>Opinion: The current Bitcoin sell-off is led by short-term holders, with over 85% of on-chain volume coming from new buyers</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22819</link>
      <description>On August 1st, Glassnode announced that within the past 24 hours, the majority of Bitcoin (BTC) on-chain spending originated from Short-Term Holders (STH). The on-chain spending by Short-Term Holders (STH) was $18.24 billion (85.5%), while for Long-Term Holders (LTH) it was $3.1 billion (14.5%), with a total spending amount of $21.34 billion.This shows that this round of selling was mainly driven by recent buyers rather than long-term investors.Note: Spending refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that was moved or utilized on the blockchain during a specific period and is not merely &quot;selling&quot; or &quot;transaction volume.&quot;</description>

      <title>On the first day of the Hong Kong Stablecoin Regulation Ordinance coming into effect, some OTC stores have temporarily closed due to unclear regulations.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22816</link>
      <description>August 1st. According to a report by Techub, on the very first day when the Hong Kong stablecoin regulations came into official effect, some Hong Kong cryptocurrency over-the-counter (OTC) offline stores, such as One Satoshi, closed temporarily out of concerns about violating regulatory requirements. Nevertheless, some OTC offline stores decided to keep operating. The operators of certain stores that chose to remain open hold the view that OTC activities involving non-Hong Kong legal tender issued overseas (like USDT) are not within the regulatory purview of the regulations.Based on the essence of Hong Kong&apos;s common law, if there is no explicit precedent determining stablecoin OTC activities as illegal, OTC businesses may still be able to carry on their operations.</description>

      <title>BiyaPay Analyst: Bitcoin Pullback Initiates August Market, Selling Pressure Unresolved, Direction Uncertain, Near-Term Facing Key Inflection Point</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22815</link>
      <description>On August 1st, according to the analysts of BiyaPay, at the start of August, the cryptocurrency market experienced an initial pullback. Currently, BTC/USDT is priced at $115,547.97, with a 24-hour decline of -2.4%. In the short term, it is still fluctuating within the range of $114,000 to $118,000. The moving average system is closely stuck together, and the market is facing a directional decision.It is worth noting that early last weekend, a large holder sold more than 80,000 BTC (approximately $9.6 billion) through Galaxy Digital OTC transactions, which exerted significant selling pressure on the market. However, BTC quickly stabilized near $119,000, demonstrating the strong liquidity absorption capacity of the market.BiyaPay Analyst Insights:- Currently, BTC is still in a consolidation phase since the end of June, with $115,000 as a key support level.- The resistance above is in the range of $118,200 to $120,000, and a breakthrough is expected to challenge the previous high.-</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22814</link>
      <description>On August 1st, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, disclosed that a motion has been submitted to a federal court, accusing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of systematically impeding the disclosure of documents related to &quot;Operation Chokepoint 2.0.&quot; The court documents indicate that despite being ordered to cooperate four times, the FDIC still refused to fully disclose the &quot;suspension letters&quot; that requested banks to suspend cryptocurrency-related transactions between 2020 and 2024. Internal policy documents confirm that the FDIC instructed its staff to &quot;withhold in full&quot; documents covered by the exemption clause of the Freedom of Information Act without differentiating between factual and analytical materials. Coinbase alleges that the agency has adopted an &quot;extremely narrow interpretation&quot; and only searched for documents submitted to the Inspector General&apos;s office, resulting in the omission of numerous key records. During a January hearing, the FDIC admi</description>
