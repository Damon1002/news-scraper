      <title>CryptoQuant Analyst: BTC Has Retraced Around 12% from Its New High, Which Is Completely Normal and Has Not Yet Exceeded the Historical Average Correction of 20% to 25%</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27301</link>
      <description>On September 2nd, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost stated that Bitcoin has retraced by approximately -12% since its previous all-time high, and this is within a normal range. During the current bull market cycle, the largest retracement since hitting an all-time high for the first time in March 2024 was -28%, with the average retracement ranging from -20% to -25%.The analysis indicates that this retracement has not deviated from historical patterns and is likely to continue to remain within a healthy range. Such retracements usually help to clear excessive leverage in the derivatives market during a bull market, alleviate overheated sentiment, and provide new entry opportunities for long-term investors.</description>

      <description>On September 2nd, ZachXBT disclosed the charging standards and wallet addresses of more than 200 crypto KOLs on the X platform yesterday. ZachXBT stated that among the more than 160 paid promoters, fewer than 5 clearly marked their posts as advertisements.ZachXBT believes that in many jurisdictions, failing to disclose the promotional nature of information may even be illegal. &quot;I have said many times that if you disclose paid promotion information for a project that you truly believe in, then paid promotion is acceptable. If you think that influential people should be allowed to secretly accept money to promote projects and mislead fans, then this indicates many problems.&quot;</description>

      <title>Matrixport: Ethereum is currently in a digestion phase after being overbought, with limited potential to retest $5000 in the short term</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27295</link>
      <description>On September 2nd, Matrixport presented a market outlook indicating that Ethereum&apos;s transaction volume sharply decreased from $122 billion to $57 billion as speculative long positions underwent liquidation. Despite several technical supports existing below, the funding rate has retreated back to below 10%, suggesting a slowdown in ETF capital inflows.At present, Ethereum is in a digestion stage following being overbought, and the implied volatility still remains at a high level. For aggressive investors, selling covered call options can enable them to capture volatility premiums, and the short-term possibility of returning to $5,000 is limited. Overall, risk control remains of key importance, and Matrixport still maintains a cautious stance after the price breaks below a crucial support.</description>
