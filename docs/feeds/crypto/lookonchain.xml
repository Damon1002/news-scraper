      <title>OpenAI has announced an improvement to ChatGPT to better respond to user emotions and mental distress</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26532</link>
      <description>On August 27th, as per The Wall Street Journal, following reports of users resorting to chatbots for assistance during emotional breakdowns, OpenAI announced its plans to enhance ChatGPT in order to better identify and respond to users&apos; psychological and emotional distress signals. OpenAI released a blog post stating, &quot;In the recent distressing events, users in a state of extreme distress used ChatGPT, which has had a significant impact on us. This has led us to believe that it is now necessary to share more information.&quot;OpenAI indicated that the upcoming updates will assist users in returning to reality even if they do not show signs of severe self-harm. The company is also exploring ways to help users connect with therapists before they reach a severe crisis. This represents a significant departure from the current mode of operation: when someone expresses a desire to self-harm, the chatbot would recommend that they contact a suicide hotline.</description>

      <title>Federal Reserve&apos;s &quot;Big Three&quot; Suggests Rate Adjustment Possible at Each Policy Meeting</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26531</link>
      <description>On August 27th, the President of the New York Fed, Williams, stated that the upcoming Fed policy meeting would be a &quot;live&quot; meeting, suggesting the possibility of an interest rate adjustment. However, he did not explicitly state which course of action he would support. In an interview today, Williams said, &quot;From my point of view, I definitely consider every meeting to be live. We are making risks more balanced.&quot; After Fed Chairman Powell stated last Friday that &quot;downside risks to employment are rising&quot; and that &quot;changes in the risk balance may require us to adjust our policy stance,&quot; investors are betting that the Fed will cut interest rates at the September meeting. Williams said that the current interest rate level is &quot;moderately restrictive,&quot; indicating that the Fed can &quot;lower rates while still maintaining a certain degree of restraint in the future, but we need to accurately assess the economic conditions.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
