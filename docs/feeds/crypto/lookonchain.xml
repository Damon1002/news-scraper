      <title>Trader Eugene: Went Long on SOL with a Small Position</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27459</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio posted on his personal channel and said, &quot;Initiated a small attempt at taking a long position in SOL.&quot;BTC has successfully regained the $110,000 level and is currently the strongest among the mainstream coins at present. Therefore, I decided to enter. With ETH losing its upward momentum and mNAVs contracting (with BMNR currently being less than 1.1 and SBET being less than 1), I anticipate that market funds will flow into those newer and lighter-weighted coins.If BTC falls below $110,000, I will make a quick adjustment or exit the position.</description>

      <title>House Appropriations Committee Republican Chair Pushes to Delay Stopgap Funding Bill to November</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27458</link>
      <description>September 3rd. According to foreign media reports, Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, stated on Tuesday that he is advocating for a stopgap measure to postpone the government shutdown threat to November this month in order to gain time for funding negotiations. Congress now must reach an agreement by September 30th to maintain government funding; otherwise, it will face the risk of the first shutdown in years. When asked about his preferred timeline for the stopgap measure, Cole said that he would prefer a &quot;to November&quot; stopgap measure, freezing funding at the current level while lawmakers negotiate the 2026 fiscal year bill. Cole further stated that lawmakers are specifically discussing pushing the deadline to at least November 6th, but he added, &quot;We will at the latest before Thanksgiving, such as the 20th.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
