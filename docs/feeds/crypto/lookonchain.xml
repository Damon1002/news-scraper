      <title>Trader Eugene: The Crypto Reserve Frenzy is the final opportunity for a large-scale altcoin bull market, currently nearing the top but not yet over</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23031</link>
      <description>On August 4th, trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio stated in a post on his personal channel that he holds a cautiously optimistic view regarding the DAT &quot;Decentralized Asset Trusts&quot; frenzy. This frenzy is approaching its zenith but has not yet come to an end, and it may potentially be the final opportunity for altcoins to ride a globally capital-backed massive bull market.It is now evident that the majority of capital is either unable or reluctant to cross the cryptocurrency realm divide through direct token purchases. The current DAT is a subpar (but similar) imitation of a meme coin ETF. We have not actually witnessed a case where DAT has led to a significant inflow of funds into an altcoin. However, considering Traditional Finance&apos;s enthusiasm for Ethereum (ETH), this possibility is quite substantial. In theory, this influx of funds should make the performance of other crypto-native projects seem insignificant in comparison. Nevertheless, the market has not yet fully recognized this.

      <title>Ethereum PoS Network Exit Queue Decreases to around 527,000 ETH, Join Queue Increases to around 150,000 ETH</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23030</link>
      <description>On August 4th, based on the data from the Validator Queue tracking website validatorqueue, the current exit queue of the Ethereum PoS network is temporarily reported to be 527,128 ETH. This is a decrease from nearly 560,000 ETH yesterday and is worth approximately $18.62 billion. The recent peak of the exit queue was 744,000 ETH. Currently, the exit waiting time is approximately 9 days and 4 hours.At the same time, the amount of ETH queued to join the network is approximately 149,701 ETH, which is an increase from 123,000 ETH yesterday and is worth approximately $5.29 billion. The expected activation delay is about 2 days and 14 hours.Previously reported, this situation reflects two opposing forces in the market. On one hand, some stakers may have decided to take profits after Ethereum rebounded by more than 160% from its April low, resulting in a surge in the exit queue. On the other hand, new funds deposited driven by regulatory optimism and institutional demand are also increasi</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23029</link>
      <description>On August 4th, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, the French far-right political party National Rally is in the process of preparing to draft a bill with the intention of using the surplus electricity from nuclear power plants to &quot;mine&quot; Bitcoin. During a visit to the Normandy Flamanville nuclear power plant on March 11th, the three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen showed her support for using the surplus electricity from nuclear reactors to &quot;mine&quot; Bitcoin. The plan entails installing high-performance computers on the premises of the French energy giant EDF. National Rally MP Aur√©lien Lopez-Liguori stated that he was assigned in July to convert this idea into a bill.</description>

      <title>CME FedWatch: 82.6% Probability of 25 Basis Point Rate Cut in September</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23023</link>
      <description>On August 4th, based on CME&apos;s &quot;FedWatch&quot; data, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut in September is 82.6%, and the probability of rates remaining unchanged is 17.4%.There is a 4.2% probability that the Fed will keep rates unchanged until October. The cumulative probability of a 25-basis-point cut is 33.1%, and the cumulative probability of a 50-basis-point cut is 62.7%.The next two FOMC meeting dates of the Fed are September 17th and October 29th.Last week, the U.S. only added 73,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, which was significantly below expectations. The data for May and June were also revised downward. Additionally, Fed Governor Quarles will resign this week, enabling Trump to appoint a preferred candidate earlier. Possibly due to the above news, the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut in September by the Fed on CME&apos;s &quot;FedWatch&quot; rose sharply. Before the nonfarm payroll data, this figure was only 41.3%.</description>
