      <title>Analysis: The era of Parabolic Bull Market and Devastating Bear Market is over, Bitcoin&apos;s future will see continued consolidation, volatility, and upward movement.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21974</link>
      <description>July 27th. Mitchell Askew, a Blockware BTC analyst, stated that Bitcoin will no longer witness a &quot;parabolic&quot; price surge or a &quot;devastating&quot; bear market. The presence of a spot ETF has permanently reduced volatility and changed market dynamics. Bitcoin seemed to be two entirely different assets before and after the ETF launch. It is expected to reach $1 million in the next 10 years through continuous oscillation between &quot;upsurge&quot; and &quot;consolidation&quot;. This path will be boring for everyone and will drive out short-term speculators. A chart shared by Mitchell Askew shows that Bitcoin&apos;s price volatility has decreased significantly since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF in the United States in January 2024.Bloomberg&apos;s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas had previously stated that the reduction in volatility helps Bitcoin attract larger investors and provides a first-line opportunity for its adoption as a currency. However, the cost may be the potential absence of &quot;god-tier candlesticks&quot;. The sp</description>

      <title>TRM Labs: Russian Entity Allegedly Using Kyrgyzstan Cryptocurrency Platform to Evade Sanctions</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21972</link>
      <description>On July 27th, as per Decrypt, a report issued by the blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs indicates that Russian entities are leveraging a Kyrgyzstan cryptocurrency platform to evade sanctions. Cryptocurrency transactions related to Russia almost entirely dominate the Kyrgyzstan cryptocurrency industry, which was &quot;practically non-existent&quot; prior to the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict.On-chain analysis reveals that the now-defunct Russian exchange Garantex has likely rebranded as Grinex and is conducting large-scale ruble-to-crypto transactions by using Russian-backed stablecoins (such as A7A5). By the end of 2022, the trading volume of Kyrgyzstan&apos;s virtual asset service providers reached $59 million, and it soared to $4.2 billion in the first seven months of 2024. These platforms have emerged as crucial channels for Russian entities to bypass sanctions and maintain access to the global financial system.</description>

      <title>Statistic: 0.76% of ETH&apos;s supply has been permanently locked, worth approximately $34.3 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21968</link>
      <description>On July 27th, Conor Grogan, an executive at Coinbase, stated in a post that based on their data, at least 913,111 ETH has been permanently lost due to user errors. This amounts to more than 0.76% of the ETH supply and is worth approximately $34.3 billion. If we add the ETH burned by EIP-1559 (5.3 million ETH), then over 5% of all ever-existing ETH (worth $23.42 billion) has been permanently destroyed.Some of the largest Ethereum permanent loss events in history include: The Web3 Foundation lost 306,000 ETH due to the Parity Multisig vulnerability; Quadriga lost 60,000 ETH due to a smart contract bug; Akutars lost 11,500 ETH in an NFT minting failure; Users collectively sent 25,000 ETH to a burn address for unknown reasons.Conor Grogan further added that the $34.3 billion figure is significantly lower than the actual amount of lost or inaccessible ETH. It only covers Ethereum that has been permanently locked and does not include all lost private keys or forgotten Genesis wallets, et</description>
