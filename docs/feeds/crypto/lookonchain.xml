      <title>Tom Lee: The Fed is embarking on a gentle rate cut cycle after a prolonged pause</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27057</link>
      <description>August 31st. In the forthcoming weeks, the U.S. stock market will encounter a crucial period that will decide whether the latest round of rebound can persist. Employment data, key inflation indicators, and the Federal Reserve&apos;s interest rate decision will all be disclosed within the next 14 trading days, thereby setting the market tone for investors. Currently, the stock market appears to be at a crossroads: the S&amp;P 500 index just achieved its weakest monthly gain since March, and September has historically been its worst-performing month. Meanwhile, market volatility has nearly vanished. The VIX fear index only touched the key level of 20 once since the end of June.&quot;It is appropriate for investors to remain cautious in September,&quot; said Tom Lee, the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. &quot;After a prolonged pause, the Federal Reserve is re-entering a mild rate-cutting cycle, making it difficult for traders to determine their positions.&quot; This long-time bullish analyst on U.S. s</description>

      <title>Analyst: Ethereum Short-term Bearish, Potential for a Breakthrough of $4,600 Resistance Level and a Run at $5,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27055</link>
      <description>On August 31st, the crypto analyst @ali_charts mentioned that if Ethereum&apos;s 4-hour closing price exceeds $4,500, it will signify a breakout of the recent high downward trend line, suggesting that bullish momentum may be on the rise. The next significant resistance level is at $4,600. If Ethereum can successfully break through this level, it may open the way for a retest of $5,000.Nevertheless, currently Ethereum is still trading within the middle of the channel, following the downward trend line. The SuperTrend indicator still shows a sell signal. Unless Ethereum can regain $4,500 and transform it into a support level, it remains bearish in the short term.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27053</link>
      <description>On August 31st, as monitored by on-chain analyst Yu Jing, starting tomorrow, the yield of public sale whales in WLFI that is set to be claimed and unlocked ranges from 7 times to 23 times.· Currently, 16.4 billion WLFI from the public sale has been activated. This indicates that 20% of it, which is 3.3 billion WLFI, will be unlocked and enter circulation tomorrow. With the current price of $0.35, the circulating market value is $1.15 billion. The actual circulation should be higher because the project team still needs to take out some tokens to provide liquidity and add as LP tokens.· The largest activated account belongs to @moonmanifest47. In the first round of public sale, they subscribed to 1 billion WLFI with 15 million USDC at a price of $0.015. Tomorrow, they will unlock and receive 200 million WLFI, which is worth $70 million at a price of $0.35.</description>

      <title>The high-profile Bitcoin whale who swapped ETH has sold 34,110 BTC over the past 11 days and bought 813,298.84 ETH.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27050</link>
      <description>On August 31st, according to the monitoring of @mlmabc, a highly prominent Bitcoin whale that has been rebalancing into ETH sold 7,000 BTC (approximately $7.59 billion) within the past 46 hours and purchased 171,791.84 ETH (approximately $7.73 billion). This whale still holds 3,000 BTC (about $3.25 billion) in the address beginning with 169qY, and it is likely that this will be rebalanced into ETH.Furthermore, the whale&apos;s wallet also contains 46,816 BTC (about $50.7 billion). Based on previous activities, another 14,495 BTC (about $15.7 billion) may be rebalanced into ETH. However, the remaining 32,321 BTC (about $35 billion) currently has an unknown movement. Overall, it seems that the whale intends to rebalance its entire holdings. This is mere speculation and not investment advice, and the true intentions of the whale remain unclear.As of now, in the past 11 days, the whale has sold 34,110 BTC (about $37 billion) and purchased 813,298.84 ETH (about $36.6 billion).</description>
