      <title>The current mainstream CEX and DEX funding rate display still indicates a bearish sentiment towards BTC and ETH in the market.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27496</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, based on Coinglass data, the current funding rates of mainstream CEX and DEX show that the market still leans towards being bearish on BTC and ETH. The specific funding rates are presented in the attached image.BlockBeats Note: The funding rate is a fee set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price. It is usually applicable to perpetual contracts and is a fund exchange mechanism between long and short traders. The trading platform does not charge this fee. It is used to adjust the cost or gain of traders holding contracts to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.When the funding rate is 0.01%, it represents the baseline rate. When the funding rate is greater than 0.01%, it indicates a general market bullish sentiment. When the funding rate is less than 0.005%, it indicates a general market bearish sentiment.</description>
