      <title>Matrixport: Retail Leveraging Surges Ahead of FOMC, Key Catalyst Could Play Out After Summer</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21486</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, Matrixport released today&apos;s market analysis which stated, &quot;In the past two weeks, the open interest of Bitcoin futures contracts has witnessed a significant increase of $6 billion. The annualized funding rate has soared to 19%, suggesting the existence of a large number of aggressive leveraged long positions in the market. Simultaneously, the activity of South Korean retail traders has increased significantly. Cryptocurrency trading volume has jumped from $10 billion to $60 billion, reflecting the dominant role of retail funds in this round of the market.&quot;However, as the price enters a consolidation phase, these high-leverage long positions may be exposed to forced liquidation risks. Especially after next week&apos;s FOMC meeting, as the market enters a relatively quiet August trading period.Despite short-term volatility, multiple key positives are accumulating for a post-summer surge, and the overall upward trend in the crypto market still remains intact.&quot;</description>
