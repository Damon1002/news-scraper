      <title>The AI Agent Platform Bankr is currently developing an API to support agent-based encrypted payments and an information layer.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22116</link>
      <description>On July 28th, the AI agent platform Bankr disclosed that it is in the process of developing the Bankr API. This API will enable agents or apps to utilize Bankr as a cryptographic payment or information layer. In the first phase, BNKR is used to pay for each query via x402 and obtain transaction data execution. In the second phase, wallet creation is supported, and it is completely controlled by the agent or app through Bankr.BlockBeats reported previously that on July 24th, Coinbase Ventures announced that it would provide support to Bankr through the Base Ecosystem Fund. Bankr is one of the agent platforms integrated into Coinbase&apos;s newly launched Base app. Transaction agents respond more quickly than humans, operate 24/7, and are capable of making more data-driven decisions.</description>

The current market sentiment is gradually becoming optimistic. This week will witness a series of key events: the intensive disclosure of U.S. stock earnings reports, the delayed release of the White House&apos;s digital asset report, and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, which may become a new round of catalysts driving market volatility.&quot;However, historical data indicates that August and September have historically been relatively weak months for Bitcoin performance.
