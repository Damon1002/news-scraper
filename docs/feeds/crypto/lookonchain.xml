      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23399</link>
      <description>On August 6th, as per The Block, following a robust uptrend in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies last month, the recent cryptocurrency price movement has been rather unimpressive. This seemingly has led some market participants to adopt a bearish stance. The cryptocurrency options platform Derive has indicated that its options positions set to expire on August 29th have shown a significant preference for Bitcoin and Ethereum put options. This indicates that traders are hedging against a potential price decline by the end of the month.Sean Dawson, the Head of Research at Derive, has stated that the number of Ethereum put options expiring by August 29th exceeds the number of call options by more than 10%. The highest interest is concentrated at strike prices of $3,200, $3,000, and $2,200. The analyst pointed out that this positioning is in line with the expectation of &quot;any scenario ranging from a mild pullback to a more significant correction.&quot; The bearish sentiment i</description>

      <title>Britain Lifts Retail Crypto ETN Ban, Indicating Efforts to Become Cryptocurrency Hub</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23396</link>
      <description>On August 6th, according to Cointelegraph&apos;s report, the UK financial regulator has removed the ban on exchange-traded notes (cETNs) for retail investors on cryptocurrency exchanges, enabling individual investors to independently assume risks and make choices on their own. This move has received industry support and is regarded as a step for the UK to align with the global crypto market and enhance its position as a hub for digital assets.Last Friday, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the UK announced the lifting of the ban on retail investor trading of cETNs, and the regulatory changes will come into effect on October 8th. The ban was implemented in January 2021 due to extreme market volatility and &quot;a lack of legitimate investment need.&quot;The reversal of the cETN ban reflects a change in the regulatory agency&apos;s stance on crypto assets. A senior FCA executive stated in a release that this decision reflects the development of the market and an increased public understanding of c</description>

      <title>Glassnode: Bitcoin Whales and Retail Investors have increased their BTC holdings over the past 15 days, which may reflect accumulation during the pullback.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23394</link>
      <description>On August 6th, Glassnode put out a post saying, &quot;During the past 15 days, both whales (those holding more than 1,000 BTC) and retail investors (those holding less than 1 BTC) have been on average adding more to their holdings than they have been selling. This shows that they have been purchasing during the recent pullback. Nevertheless, this signal is lagging as it represents smoothed data over a 15-day period.&quot;</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23395</link>
      <description>On August 6th, as per foreign media reports, the U.S. government is on the verge of releasing the investigation results of Section 232 regarding specific industries such as global semiconductors, pharmaceutical raw materials, servers, key components, minerals, etc. Economists have pointed out that procedurally, after the investigation results are out, the U.S. President will take action within 90 days upon receiving the report. During this period, all countries have the opportunity to negotiate with the U.S. Therefore, similar to the tariff retaliation in early April, the investigation results and tariff plans of Section 232 are not anticipated to be implemented immediately. The U.S. may introduce an investment framework or structure to further negotiate U.S. investment with other countries, with conditions that might involve different durations and amounts, in exchange for a reduction in tariff rates. Regarding the semiconductor tariff rate, economists have speculated on levels rangin</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23391</link>
      <description>On August 6th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin surges past $115,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will reach $694 million.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $112,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will be $843 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not present the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually indicate the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows the extent to which the asset price reaching a certain position will be impacted. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; signify that when the price reaches those levels, a more intense reaction will occur due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
