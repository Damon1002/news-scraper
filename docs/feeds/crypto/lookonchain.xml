      <title>BTCS CEO: Frequent Public Disclosure of Crypto Holdings Not Necessarily in Shareholders&apos; Best Interests</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24910</link>
      <description>On August 17th, Charles Allen, the CEO of the Ethereum strategic reserve company BTCS, mentioned that although the cryptocurrency field attaches great importance to real-time transparency, U.S. listed companies adhere to a quarterly disclosure rhythm. For major events, they are required to disclose within 4 days, which is the current stipulation.U.S. listed companies are naturally able to choose to disclose information more frequently as long as they refrain from involving GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) metrics that demand auditor review.However, more frequent disclosure is not always beneficial to shareholders. The board has a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of shareholders. After all, revealing all one&apos;s cards on the table is not the winning approach in the game.</description>

      <title>Canary CEO: Bitcoin Expected to Reach $150,000 This Year, Ethereum&apos;s Ability to Sustain Its Growth Trajectory Remains Uncertain</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24901</link>
