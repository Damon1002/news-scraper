      <title>The Trump Media &amp; Technology Group has invested $300 million to participate in a strategy involving options linked to Bitcoin-related securities.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22096</link>
      <description>On July 28th, according to Bloomberg&apos;s report, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) disclosed last week that it has put $300 million into a strategy that involves options linked to Bitcoin-related securities.Although many details remain unclear, this investment shows that Trump Media is resorting to leveraging Bitcoin&apos;s price. Trump&apos;s past social media posts on his &quot;Truth Social&quot; account have had an impact on the price of this cryptocurrency, and options strategies can assist investors in profiting from this price volatility.Castle Island Ventures partner Nick Carter stated that he voted for Trump and still supports him, but his association with the industry may lead to conflicts of interest, especially when options trading brings different risks and rewards into play.</description>
