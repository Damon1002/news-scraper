      <title>Bessenet: The More Tariff Revenue, the Harder to Overturn Trump&apos;s Trade Policy</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24371</link>
      <description>On August 13th, U.S. Treasury Secretary Benson stated in an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday that as tariff revenue keeps flowing into the U.S. Treasury. If tariff litigation cases in lower courts are eventually appealed to the Supreme Court, the increasing fiscal revenue will make it challenging for the Supreme Court to issue a ruling unfavorable to the Trump administration. Benson said, &quot;The more fiscal revenue there is, the more difficult it is for the Supreme Court to make a ruling against us.&quot; This statement comes in response to a case being heard by the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The case questions the legality of Trump&apos;s so-called &quot;reciprocal&quot; tariffs and also challenges another set of tariff measures imposed in February on China, Canada, and Mexico.</description>

      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Futures Leverage Surges in August, Market Volatility and Liquidation Risk Rise</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24370</link>
      <description>On August 13th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. posted that in August 2025, the Bitcoin Futures Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) showed a 30-day change reaching the highest level in the past five years, surpassing the critical value of +0.4. Previously, this threshold has usually occurred at peak periods with high leverage and increased market fragility. This indicates that near historical price highs, there is a significant and rapid inflow of leveraged positions in the futures market, which potentially leads to increased market volatility and a heightened risk of severe liquidation events.</description>
