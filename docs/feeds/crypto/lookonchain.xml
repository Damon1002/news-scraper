      <title>CryptoPunks Floor Price Surpasses $200,000 Mark for the First Time in Over a Year</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22253</link>
      <description>July 29th. As per Decrypt, since August of the previous year, the floor price of CryptoPunks has been on a continuous upward trajectory, increasing from 20.45 ETH to 53.98 ETH, which represents a 163% growth. Given the current Ethereum price of approximately $3,745, the floor price of CryptoPunks has exceeded $200,000 and reached its highest point since March 8, 2024. This upward trend commenced with a large-scale &quot;buying spree&quot; last week when an address made a single transaction to purchase 45 CryptoPunks.According to CoinGecko data, the total market value of the NFT market has witnessed a significant surge, rising from $3.6 billion in early July to $6.8 billion. Historical data indicates that when Ethereum shows strong performance, it often leads to an increase in the prices of leading NFT projects on its blockchain.</description>

      <title>Institution: The Federal Reserve is expected to remain on hold this week, with two major doves likely to dissent.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22250</link>
      <description>On July 29th, Pascal&apos;s Chief U.S. Economist Urup Ruxi stated that it is anticipated that the Federal Reserve will maintain the interest rate at 4.25%-4.5% unchanged this week. However, Waller and Bowman may express opposition. This might heighten speculation that once more officials appointed by Trump start to serve on the Fed&apos;s Board of Governors starting from the first quarter of 2026, the pace of rate cuts will quicken.The dovish Waller and Bowman may contend that monetary policy is restrictive because tariff-related inflation is being offset by other factors and advocate for a rate cut by citing a neutral rate close to 3%. It is expected that Powell will attempt to guide the FOMC to wait as long as possible for the next rate cut, with higher probabilities of a rate cut in October compared to September.

      <title>Dragonfly Partner: U.S. Department of Justice Has Clarified It Will Not Bring Charges Against Dragonfly or Its Employees</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22244</link>
      <description>On July 29th, regarding the news of &quot;The US Department of Justice Considering Charges Against Dragonfly Employees in the TornadoCash Case&quot;, Haseeb, a partner of Dragonfly, wrote a post again and attached a court record stating: &quot;The court record on Monday shows that the US Department of Justice has clarified that media reports about their plans to sue Dragonfly were inaccurate. Neither Dragonfly nor any of its key personnel are the subjects of their investigation. Dragonfly, as an investor, may face a lawsuit merely because it supported an open-source privacy technology. This is not only unprecedented but also clearly violates the Department of Justice&apos;s policy.&quot;</description>
