      <description>On September 7th, on-chain data analyst Murphy released an analysis of SOL&apos;s on-chain structure. As depicted in the chart, the SOL chip distribution roughly assumes an olive-shaped structure, with a significant accumulation in the middle and slightly less at the extremities. With the current price of $203 as the center, SOL accumulated within the top 20% price range (that is, $203 to $242) makes up 7% of the total circulation, while SOL accumulated within the bottom -20% price range (that is, $162 to $203) accounts for 39.2% of the circulating chips.If the future SOL price continues to ascend and there are few trapped chips above, the main selling pressure will originate from the chips below engaging in profit-taking. Through recent repeated oscillations, SOL has achieved very thorough handovers within the -20% price range, elevating the average cost of all participants. Therefore, when there is a certain degree of unrealized profit, theoretically, the selling pressure will not be su</description>

      <title>The current mainstream CEX and DEX funding rate display indicates a bearish market sentiment.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/28004</link>
      <description>On September 7th, based on Coinglass data, the current mainstream CEX and DEX funding rates suggest that the market has inclined towards bearishness. The specific funding rates are as presented in the following chart.BlockBeats Notes: The funding rate is a rate set by cryptocurrency exchanges to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price. It is usually applicable to perpetual contracts and is a fund exchange mechanism between long and short traders. The trading platform does not charge this fee. It is used to adjust the cost or profit of traders holding contracts to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.When the funding rate is 0.01%, it represents the baseline rate. When the funding rate is greater than 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market. When the funding rate is less than 0.005%, it indicates a generally bearish market.</description>
