      <title>Opinion: Bitcoin May Enter Consolidation Phase as Trading Volume Stabilizes, Suggesting the Arrival of a &quot;Summer Lull&quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22263</link>
      <description>July 29th - Matrixport disclosed today&apos;s market analysis, suggesting that investors might be observing the early indications of &quot;summer fatigue.&quot; The trading volume has begun to stabilize. Although the current market activity remains at a relatively high level, the absence of clear catalysts in August may lead to a significant deceleration in the market—especially since retail participants tend to reduce their participation during holidays.Each of the three major volume surges in the past 18 months has triggered a strong market rally but occurred sporadically. This once more emphasizes the significance for investors to closely monitor market signals.Historically, a reduction in trading volume usually indicates that Bitcoin is entering a consolidation phase. As August approaches, the market may currently be entering a similar stage.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22261</link>
      <description>July 29th. According to Ming Pao, the Hong Kong Stablecoin Regulation is set to come into effect in August. Local media referred to a registration document suggesting that JD.com&apos;s JD Coin Chain has registered &quot;JCOIN&quot; and &quot;JOYCOIN&quot;, with some noting that these names are likely the designations of its stablecoins.As per the registration document mentioned in the report, the services associated with &quot;JCOIN&quot; and &quot;JOYCOIN&quot; involve providing electronic fund transfers and cryptocurrency financial transactions via blockchain technology.JD Coin Chain is one of the Stablecoin Issuers participating in the sandbox of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

      <title>HTX DeepThink: Policy Maneuvering Meets Earnings Season, Crypto Market&apos;s Short-Term Direction May Soon Become Clear</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22260</link>
      <description>On July 29th, the HTX Researcher Chloe pointed out in the latest edition of HTX DeepThink that during this week&apos;s Bank of Japan interest rate decision, the core PCE data closely watched by the Federal Reserve, and the earnings reports of multiple US tech giants will jointly influence the short-term direction of global risk assets.Currently, Japanese inflation is stabilizing, and the market is observing whether it will adjust its interest rate hike path. If the policy coordination between the US and Japan strengthens, it may stabilize the Asian foreign exchange market structure and indirectly boost the liquidity in the East Asian cryptocurrency market. The activity of users on the platforms in Hong Kong and South Korea is worthy of attention. The US non-farm payroll data (NFP) released on Friday is regarded as the &quot;key macroeconomic indicator.&quot; If employment growth slows in line with wage growth, it will provide support for the Fed&apos;s future shift to a rate cut.At the same time, the</description>

      <title>If Bitcoin surpasses $120,000, the mainstream CEX&apos;s total short liquidation volume will reach 1.04 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22258</link>
      <description>On July 29th, according to data from Coinglass, if Bitcoin breaks through $120,000, the cumulative intensity of short liquidation on mainstream CEXs will reach $1.04 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin falls below $117,000, the cumulative intensity of long liquidation on mainstream CEXs will reach $784 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the asset price will be affected when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that once the price reaches that level, it will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>Ethereum Co-Founder: SharpLink Aims to Accumulate ETH Faster than Other Companies</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22255</link>
      <description>On July 29th, as per Cointelegraph, Joe Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, is one of the Ethereum Treasury Strategists at SharpLink Gaming. He anticipates that the company can amass Ethereum (ETH) for its shareholders as promptly as feasible, raising the &quot;battle cry&quot; during the corporate rush to become the foremost ETH accumulator.Joe Lubin declared: &quot;We hold the view that, on a per-share (fully-diluted) basis, our rate of ETH accumulation will outstrip that of any other Ethereum project and definitely be quicker than Bitcoin-related projects. SharpLink is accumulating funds &apos;daily&apos; through a market-price-based issuance mechanism to augment its ETH reserves, while staking existing holdings to earn rewards and achieve compound growth.&quot;SharpLink is vying with BitMine for the status of &quot;Ethereum Treasury Premier Company.&quot; According to the data from StrategicETHReserve, BitMine currently leads, holding 566,800 ETH with a market value of approximately $2.13 billion,</description>
