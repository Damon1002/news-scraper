      <title>Analysis: Ethereum faces a key resistance at $4700, while Bitcoin encounters a significant resistance at $127,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24324</link>
      <description>August 13th, based on the indicator of the +1 standard deviation level of the realized price (which usually indicates the start of increasing selling pressure), glassnode drew a conclusion about the current Ethereum trend. The $4700 price point has become a key resistance level that needs to be monitored. A decisive breakthrough at this level may indicate the beginning of a more speculative phase, but if the sentiment changes, it will also increase the risk of a sharp reversal.This level holds historical importance.

      <title>Ethereum is only 5.14% away from its all-time high. If it reaches ATH, the short liquidation pressure will reach 1.23 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24317</link>
      <description>On August 13th, with Ethereum reaching a price of over $4600 this morning, it is merely 5.14% away from its all-time high of $4868.According to data from Coinglass, if Ethereum breaks through $4868, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will amount to $1.23 billion.On the other hand, if Ethereum drops below $4500, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will reach $1.252 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the contracts to be liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the target price will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will have a more intense response due to a surge in liquidity.</description>
