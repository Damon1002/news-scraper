Yellen had previously stated that &quot;regardless of any model,&quot; the rate &quot;should be reduced by 150 to 175 basis points.&quot; However, subsequent attempts to search for a model to support this statement have been unsuccessful, and the Deutsche Bank strategist team led by Matthew Raskin has recently joined this verification effort.Former Fed economist and advisor Raskin and his team stated in a report on Tuesday that the rule used by the Fed in its semi-annual monetary policy report &quot;does not clearly indicate a rate cut, let alone a cut of 150 to 175 basis points.&quot;They pointed out: &quot;It should be noted that the current federal funds rate is precisely within the relatively narrow range specified by the rule,&quot; approximately between 4% and 4.65%, which suggests that a</description>

      <title>If Ethereum falls below $4,000, the mainstream CEX cumulative long liquidation intensity will reach $1.223 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25249</link>
      <description>On August 20th, based on Coinglass data, if Ethereum drops below $4000, the cumulative intensity of long liquidation on mainstream CEX will reach 1.223 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum rebounds above $4300, the cumulative intensity of short liquidation on mainstream CEX will reach 1.336 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not precisely display the number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of the contracts to be liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a certain position. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will have a more intense response due to a liquidity cascade once it reaches that level.</description>
