      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23268</link>
      <description>On August 5th, &quot;We have always been conducting trade within the context of American exceptionalism. The United States is undoubtedly the world&apos;s most powerful economy. In my opinion, the situation has undergone a change,&quot; stated Erik Nelson, the Global Foreign Exchange Strategist at Wells Fargo. &quot;There are potential structural issues - such as the independence of the Fed and the quality of data, to name just a few. When it comes to the economic backdrop, all of these are heading in the wrong direction. In the foreseeable future, people will be inclined to sell the dollar during rallies.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
