      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22278</link>
      <description>On July 29th, as per the report by CoinDesk, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, recently advised investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to Bitcoin or gold. He did this by citing the growing debt burden in the United States and the risks associated with long-term currency devaluation.Dalio stated on the &quot;Master Investor&quot; podcast, &quot;If you aim to optimize the risk-return ratio of your portfolio, then approximately 15% of your funds should be allocated to gold or Bitcoin.&quot;This perspective represents a notable shift from his 2022 recommendation of only a 1â€“2% Bitcoin allocation, which reflects his increasing worry about the so-called &quot;debt crisis loop.&quot; He pointed out that the United States is projected to issue an additional $12 trillion in new national debt within the next year in order to address the current $36.7 trillion national debt.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22277</link>
      <description>July 29th: The U.S. Trade Representative, Grier, stated that the U.S. and India need to engage in more negotiations prior to the tariff deadline on August 1st and approach with caution regarding the possibility of reaching an agreement. Although India had previously expressed a willingness to impose zero tariffs on certain goods, it has set red lines for core industries such as agriculture and dairy.

In the crypto market, the price of BTC rebounded after testing 117,400 multiple times yesterday and is currently fluctuating within the range of 118,000 - 120,000.Bitunix analyst&apos;s suggestion: The deadlock in U.S.-India negotiations has heightened the demand for safe-haven assets, and BTC still has short-term support; however, the upward momentum is limited. It is recommended that investors focus on the support level near 118,000 and strictly manage stop-loss; if the price fails to effectiv</description>
