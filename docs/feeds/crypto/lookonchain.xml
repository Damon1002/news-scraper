      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26821</link>
      <description>On August 29th, as per on-chain analyst @mlmabc, the renowned trader TechnoRevenant is maintaining a significant long position in XPL with low leverage on Hyperliquid. Currently, he holds 28,295,963 long contracts of XPL (approximately $31.1 million), which accounts for 35.5% of Hyperliquid&apos;s total open interest ($87.5 million). In addition, he also has $26.534 million of idle funds in USDC on Hyperliquid.It is worth noting that all these positions are leveraged at less than 1x, and he is gradually conducting a TWAP operation instead of making purchases in the market, thereby minimizing the impact on the short-term market.</description>
