      <title>Rialo: The Club is now open, and eligible members can access it early.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25402</link>
      <description>On August 20th, the new blockchain Rialo announced that its Club has now opened, and eligible members can obtain early access and become Rialo Club members.Previously, on August 2nd, the crypto startup Subzero Labs completed a $20 million seed round of funding with Pantera Capital taking the lead. Subzero Labs intends to launch a new blockchain named Rialo which is targeted at real-world applications. Rialo is not a conventional Layer 1 blockchain â€” Adepoju stated that it is &quot;not Layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6,&quot; and he is reluctant to make analogies to existing crypto products. Rialo is designed for developers without a crypto background, enabling engineers to build on the blockchain what is usually achievable only off-chain. For instance, it can access off-chain data without an oracle, like FICO credit scores.</description>

      <title>Cryptoquant: Strategy Accumulation Not Necessarily a Sign of Bottoming Out, but Aligns with Market Momentum and Boosts Sentiment</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25400</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Cryptoquant issued a market analysis indicating that the buy orders of Strategy do not always match the local bottoms and boost the price of BTC. Generally, they purchase OTC and settle on-chain in batches. Sometimes this practice is in line with market momentum, boosting market sentiment, but the market depth far exceeds any single transaction.The best way to interpret the buy orders of Strategy is to regard their purchases as part of the demand background and then confirm through ETF flows, spot CVD, and the Coinbase premium on the US trading platform.</description>

      <title>Capital Economics: Market Overestimating Fed Rate Cut Prospects, US Short-Term Rates Face Upside Risk</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25398</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Kevin Thozet, a member of the TCW Group Macro Investment Committee, stated in a report that there are upward risks to the US short-term interest rate, and the market is overly confident about the prospects of the Fed&apos;s interest rate cuts. The US money market has already priced in at least two interest rate cuts this year, which reflects the market&apos;s expectation that signs of a further slowdown in the US economy and inflation will emerge. Thozet said: &quot;Considering the resilience of the US economy, policy uncertainty, and the persistence of inflation pressure, we believe this expectation is too high.&quot; The trend of long-term US Treasury bond yields is more balanced. The current 10-year US Treasury bond yield at 4.300% is expected to fluctuate within a range of approximately 50 basis points above and below the current level. (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4,000, the cumulative long liquidation pressure from major CEXs will reach $1.841 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25397</link>
      <description>On August 20th, based on Coinglass data, if Ethereum drops below $4000, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX in terms of long positions will reach $1.841 billion.On the other hand, if Ethereum rebounds above $4300, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX in terms of short positions will reach $1.88 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the contracts to be liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity. Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the price of the underlying asset will be impacted when it reaches a certain position. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that the price will have a more pronounced reaction due to a liquidity cascade when it reaches that point.</description>
