      <title>Analyst: ETH May Retrace to $3,350 Support in September, Start Rebound in October Towards New High</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27293</link>
      <description>September 2nd. As per Cointelegraph, analyst Johnny Woo declared: &quot;ETH might initially present a bearish outlook. However, if the trend unfolds as anticipated, this could potentially be the most significant bear trap I have ever witnessed.&quot;He further added that the chart suggests that ETH might form a &quot;head and shoulders&quot; pattern in September and then experience a breakout in an &quot;October rally.&quot; In this situation, Ethereum could decline to around $3,350 as a support level in September and subsequently rebound in October, surging to a new all-time high in November.A comparable situation took place in September 2021 when ETH dropped by 30% from $3,950 to $2,750 only to rebound to a new all-time high in November.</description>

      <title>European Central Bank Executive Board Member Schnabel: Central Bank Should Keep Rates Unchanged, Inflation Could Still Be Higher Than Expected</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27291</link>
      <description>September 2nd - Fabio Panetta, who is a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, expressed that the ECB should keep the interest rate at the present level. This stance is founded on the Eurozone economy&apos;s ability to withstand U.S. tariffs and the potential that the inflation rate might still be higher than anticipated. The ECB previously concluded a one-year period of loose monetary policy and is currently evaluating the comprehensive impact of the July agreement on U.S. tariffs to determine whether further interest rate cuts are required. Panetta is one of the most significant hawks at the ECB and holds the view that there is no necessity for additional rate cuts. The current policy rate of 2% may &quot;moderately&quot; stimulate the already vibrant economy. She stated: &quot;I think we may have already implemented a slightly accommodative policy, so I do not perceive a reason for further rate cuts in the current circumstances.&quot; (FX678)</description>

      <title>Analyst: Since Bitcoin broke $100,000 earlier this year, hodlers have been continuously selling their Bitcoin.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27288</link>
      <description>September 2nd: The Coindesk analyst Omkar Godbole pointed out that Bitcoin long-term holders, including those wallets that have remained inactive for many years, have been continuously selling ever since Bitcoin exceeded $100,000 earlier this year. Investors considered that the $100,000 Bitcoin price was too high and thus chose to realize profits, suggesting that the market might require some time to adjust to $100,000 as the new standard for Bitcoin. We are likely to continue to witness volatile trading in order to assist investors in gradually getting accustomed to this elevated valuation level.</description>
