      <title>Trader Eugene: I have once again gone long on ETH, not advisable to quickly switch to a short position</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22904</link>
      <description>On August 2nd, Trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio posted on his personal channel, indicating that he has once again taken a long position on ETH. The bullish sentiment in August was hyped prematurely by the market. However, $113,000 for BTC and $3,500 for ETH are still reasonable entry points, with stop-loss set below $112,000 and $3,400 respectively.Although the hype about Data Availability Technology (DAT) may gradually wane, there is still significant structural buying interest in the current market. Therefore, it is not advisable to switch to a bearish outlook too hastily. Many people have been constantly jumping back and forth between &quot;bull market return&quot; and &quot;total collapse,&quot; yet they fail to realize that the market does not follow a simple binary path.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22902</link>
      <description>On August 2nd, the CryptoQuant analyst Axel posted on social media that starting from July 31st, traders have begun to actively close long positions. In the past 24 hours, there has been a significant sell-off in the futures market. When the price dropped to a local low of $112,000, the net inflow volume over 6 hours plummeted to an extremely low level of -$175 million, indicating the dominance of bears. As the market stabilized to a certain extent, the pressure of this indicator has decreased to -$78 million, narrowing the negative gap by 2.2 times. However, the overall market imbalance still leans towards the bears. In the past 24 hours, the volume of open interest has increased to the range of $3.04 billion. Sellers are continuing to accumulate positions and are trying to take advantage of the bearish sentiment in the market.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22897</link>
      <description>On August 2nd, Arthur Hayes gave a response regarding the recent profit-taking activities on social media. He stated, &quot;The U.S. tariff relief program is set to expire in the third quarter... at least, this is how the market perceives it following the release of the non-farm payroll data. Currently, major economies have not been able to generate credit at a sufficient pace to boost nominal GDP. Therefore, Bitcoin will undergo a test at $100,000, and Ethereum will be tested at $3,000. For more details, please attend my keynote speech at WebX Asia in Tokyo on August 25th. I am now going to take some time to relax.&quot;It was previously reported by BlockBeats that Arthur Hayes sold 2,373 ETH ($8.32 million), 7.76 million ENA ($4.62 million), and 38.86 billion PEPE ($41,470) earlier today.</description>
