      <title>「Fed Megaphone」: Federal Reserve Board nominee Milan&apos;s Consideration of Term Appointment While Retaining White House Role Seen as Unusual Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27774</link>
      <description>On September 5th, in an article by the &quot;Fed Whisperer&quot; Nick Timiraos, it was reported that Tomas Philipson, the governor of the Riksbank and a nominee for the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, indicated that after fulfilling a short-term role at the Fed, he plans to return to his original position at the White House next year. This arrangement has no precedent since Congress tried to separate the executive branch from the Fed decades ago.During Thursday&apos;s Senate confirmation hearing, Philipson stated that his legal team advised him that he could take unpaid leave from his current position as the Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, enabling him to return next year without the need for a new round of Senate confirmation. Philipson was nominated to fill the term left by Kudlow, who unexpectedly resigned last month, and the term will last until January 31, 2026.Democratic lawmakers questioned whether this arrangement might affect his ability to maintain independent judgmen</description>

      <title>The Trump Administration Submits New Evidence, Seeks Court Support to Impeach Federal Reserve Board Member Powell</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27773</link>
      <description>On September 5th, the U.S. Department of Justice presented new evidence to support the claim that President Trump should be allowed to remove Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook. It was stated that her assertion of a &quot;rate cut excuse&quot; is baseless. Cook has been accused of mortgage fraud and is currently contesting the decision to dismiss her. On Thursday, U.S. government lawyers once more urged the judge to reject Cook&apos;s request to prevent her dismissal during the lawsuit, reinforcing the arguments put forward during last week&apos;s hearing.A few hours before this filing, reports indicated that the Department of Justice had launched a criminal investigation into Cook. The U.S. government argues that the fraud charges initially raised by FHFA Director Puert now serve as a sufficient &quot;reason&quot; under U.S. law for Trump to fire her.In Thursday&apos;s filing, the Department of Justice emphasized that the judge must not &quot;question&quot; Trump&apos;s judgment regarding having a valid reason for dismissal.</description>

      <title>Federal Reserve Board Nominee Miller: Did Not Consult White House on Long-Term Tenure</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27772</link>
      <description>September 5th. Stephen Moore, a nominee for the Federal Reserve Board by US President Trump, stated on Thursday that he had not engaged in any discussions with anyone at the White House regarding the possibility of being nominated for a long-term position. He had previously informed senators that only a nomination for a long-term position would lead him to resign from his current position as a White House economic advisor, rather than simply taking a leave of absence.When questioned by reporters on this matter, Moore initially raised his eyebrows and refused to respond. When asked again, &quot;Really none at all?&quot; he briefly replied, &quot;None.&quot; During Moore&apos;s nomination hearing, Democratic senators expressed concerns that his failure to resign from the Economic Advisory Committee would cause him to yield to pressure from President Trump during interest rate votes. Moore denied these concerns. (Golden Finance)</description>
