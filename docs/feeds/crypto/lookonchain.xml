      <title>The U.S. CFTC will issue guidance clarifying the rules for foreign trading platform registration.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26756</link>
      <description>On August 29th, Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett disclosed that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is scheduled to issue guidance to clarify its Foreign Board of Trade (FBOT) registration rules. This provides a legal avenue for non-U.S. exchanges to enable U.S. users to trade on their platforms. Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham stated that this is a means to bring crypto activities &quot;back to the U.S.&quot; as such activities had previously flowed out due to enforcement actions during the Biden administration. At the same time, it reaffirms the regulatory framework that has been in place since the 1990s. For U.S. traders, this implies that they can legally access more global liquidity. For the crypto industry, this is another step towards regulatory clarity and is also part of the Trump administration&apos;s &quot;crypto sprint&quot; strategy.</description>
