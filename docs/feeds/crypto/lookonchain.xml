      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4200, the cumulative long liquidation on major CEXs will reach $520 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24988</link>
      <description>On August 18th, based on Coinglass data, if Ethereum drops below $4200, the cumulative long liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX will reach 520 million.Conversely, if Ethereum surges above $4450, the cumulative short liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX will reach 801 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the precise number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of contracts to be liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree reaching a certain price level will have an impact. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, it will trigger a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>Lazarus Group Accused of Stealing ￡17 Million in Cryptocurrency, Leading to the Collapse of Cryptocurrency Exchange Lykke</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24983</link>
      <description>On August 18th, the North Korean hacking group Lazarus Group has been determined to be the likely mastermind behind the funds stolen from the UK-registered cryptocurrency exchange Lykke. If verified, this would mark the largest cryptocurrency theft carried out by North Korea in the UK up to now. In recent years, this isolated nation has acquired billions of dollars in funds through cryptocurrency theft to support its military and nuclear programs.Lykke, which was founded in 2015 and has its headquarters in Switzerland but is registered in the UK, stated last year that it suffered a total loss of $22.8 million in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, which forced it to suspend operations. In March of this year, a UK court ruled in favor of the liquidation of the company following a lawsuit brought by more than 70 affected users.The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) under the UK Treasury identified North Korea as a potential perpetrator in a recent report.</description>
