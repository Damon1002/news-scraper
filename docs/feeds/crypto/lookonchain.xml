      <title>LD Capital Founder Jack Yi: The market has completely entered a long-term bull, and may bid farewell to the traditional 4-year cycle pattern</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21982</link>
      <description>On July 27th, Jack Yi, the founder of LD Capital, posted, expressing that the market has completely entered a long bull market and may bid farewell to the traditional 4-year cycle pattern. Stablecoins and blockchain present the best opportunity for the globalization of the US dollar. Coin and equity investments combined with stablecoin interest will continue to attract new users and funds to the market. The recent hottest trend is the coin and equity model, which is indeed an innovative invention. Compared to the US stock market, the cryptocurrency market is relatively small. With the success of BTC and ETH, mainstream coins such as SUI, BNB, SOL, TON, LTC, etc. will take advantage of this opportunity to rise even further. Following them will be smaller market cap altcoins.</description>

      <title>Next week will see a dense release of macroeconomic data, and the market still expects the Federal Reserve to once again stand pat.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21978</link>
      <description>On July 27th: Against the complex backdrop of escalating political pressure, the continuous evolution of trade policies, and conflicting economic signals, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell and his colleagues will enter the interest rate decision meeting in the coming week. This decision coincides with a rare data-intensive week - the U.S. government will consecutively release GDP, jobs reports, and the Fed&apos;s core inflation indicator. While the market generally anticipates that the Fed will once again maintain stability, this series of data may reshape the policy path. Economists predict that the U.S. second-quarter GDP annualized growth rate, which will be released on Wednesday of next week, is expected to reach 2.4% (a significant improvement compared to the 0.5% contraction in the first quarter), but this is mainly due to a substantial narrowing of the trade deficit. The July non-farm payroll report, which will be released on Friday, is expected to confirm a cautious trend in business</description>
