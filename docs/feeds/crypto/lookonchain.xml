      <title>Vitalik: Ethereum will eventually achieve instant cross-L2 native asset transfers via L1</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23462</link>
      <description>On August 7th, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, stated in a post that he was very pleased to witness many mainstream Layer 2 solutions entering Stage 1, which is the &quot;limited training rounds&quot;. The next objective is to achieve fast withdrawals through a zero-knowledge proof system. He considers this to be more significant than reaching Stage 2, which is &quot;without training rounds&quot;. Fast withdrawal times are of great importance as they will lower the capital costs for liquidity providers. If the native withdrawal time can be shortened to less than 1 hour in the short term and to 12 seconds in the medium term, Ethereum Layer 1 will further enhance its position as the default platform for issuing assets and as the economic center of the Ethereum ecosystem.For this to be achieved, we need to give up the Optimistic proof system, which essentially requires waiting for several days to make a withdrawal.

      <title>Tornado Cash Case Reaches Partial Settlement: Guilty of Operating Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23461</link>
      <description>On August 7th, during the trial of Roman Storm, the co-founder of Tornado Cash, a partial verdict was reached. The charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business was sustained. The charge of money laundering conspiracy remains undetermined. And the third charge (evading sanctions) resulted in an acquittal.Roman Storm stood trial in the federal court of the Southern District of New York. This case could potentially set a legal precedent regarding the extent of responsibility that developers should bear when the decentralized software they created is used illegally. The U.S. prosecutors accused Storm of conspiracy in money laundering, violating U.S. sanction regulations, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. If found guilty, he could face a maximum prison term of 40 years.</description>
