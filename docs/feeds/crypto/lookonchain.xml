      <title>If Ethereum breaks $3900, the mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation pressure will reach 740 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21999</link>
      <description>On July 27th, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum surpasses $3900, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will amount to 740 million.Conversely, if Ethereum drops below $3700, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach 1.528 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of contracts to be liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the relative significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to the adjacent liquidation cluster, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the target price will be influenced when it reaches a particular position. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, it will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>

      <title>Chinese Bank Former President: Stablecoin Has an Innovative Role in Facilitating Finance, But Also Poses Systemic Financial Risks</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22001</link>
      <description>On July 27th, Li Lihui, the former President of Bank of China, stated at the &quot;2025 International Monetary Forum&quot; that stablecoins play a role in providing innovative financial convenience while also presenting systemic financial risks.He noted that the United States hopes to link stablecoins to the US dollar in order to maintain its global currency hegemony. If the United States fails to improve its twin deficits, it may have an impact on the stability of its currency value. Additionally, he pointed out that Hong Kong&apos;s stablecoin can relax domestic access conditions when the appropriate conditions are met, which will assist in the internationalization of the RMB.He also emphasized the need to monitor the dynamics of the decentralized financial market represented by the United States and enhance China&apos;s position in the global monetary and financial system.</description>
