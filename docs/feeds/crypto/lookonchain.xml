      <title>If Bitcoin surpasses $115,000, the mainstream CEX total short liquidation volume will reach $1.642 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25691</link>
      <description>On August 22nd, according to Coinglass data, in the event that Bitcoin breaks through $115,000, the cumulative short liquidation strength of mainstream CEXs will reach $1.642 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $111,000, the cumulative long liquidation strength of mainstream CEXs will reach $1.232 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the precise value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the strength.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the asset price will be influenced when it reaches a particular level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, it will trigger a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
