      <title>If Bitcoin breaks $112,000, the mainstream CEX total short liquidation volume will reach $973 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27272</link>
      <description>On September 2nd, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $112,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX will reach $973 million.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $108,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX will reach $773 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the asset price will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that the price will undergo a more intense reaction due to a surge in liquidity.</description>

      <description>On September 2nd, the price of gold exceeded $3500 per ounce, reaching a new record high. Since 2025, the spot gold price has cumulatively increased by 33%, highlighting the continuous growth in the safe-haven value of gold against the backdrop of global macroeconomic uncertainty and intensified market volatility. Data indicates that in 2025, the proportion of gold held by global central banks as part of their foreign exchange reserves exceeded that of U.S. Treasury bonds for the first time. Central bank gold purchases and the Fed&apos;s rate cuts will continue to support the gold price, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are optimistic about the gold price reaching $4000.Introduced by Matrixdock, XAUm, as one of the top 3 on-chain adoption rates of gold tokens, effectively combines the traditional value of gold with digital accessibility, providing the market with a convenient way to efficiently allocate gold assets.

      <title>Among the top 10 holders of WLFI, 80% have chosen to take profits, while the top holder still retains the majority of the tokens.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27265</link>
      <description>September 2nd. According to on-chain analyst Ai Yi (@ai_9684xtpa), the selling behavior of the top 10 WLFI holders is presented as follows:· 80% of the holders have decided to take profits partially or fully. Only TOP2 and TOP5 have not yet transferred or sold any tokens.· The TOP1 holder, moonmanifest.eth, chose to retain the majority of the tokens. With the decline of WLFI, the unrealized gains on their 1 billion tokens have experienced a significant pullback. However, based on the current price of $0.2318, they still hold a value of 2.3 billion US dollars.· The TOP6 holder, convexcuck.eth, sold $3.8 million worth of WLFI to 36 buyers through Whales Market. It is likely that they are a key trader in the platform&apos;s OTC WLFI trading.</description>
