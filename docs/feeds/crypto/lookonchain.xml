      <title>Former Governor of the People&apos;s Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan: Stablecoins May Trigger Speculation, Limited Advantage in Cross-Border Payments</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26596</link>
      <description>On August 28th, as reported by Bloomberg, former central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan cautioned in a closed-door meeting held in mid-July that stablecoins have the potential to trigger speculative behavior, thereby endangering financial stability.Zhou Xiaochuan pointed out that stablecoins offer only limited advantages over China&apos;s existing retail payment system in terms of cost, and the claim that traditional cross-border payments are &quot;very costly&quot; may be overstated. He also stated that the regulatory frameworks in the US, Hong Kong, and Singapore have not yet fully met the requirement that stablecoins should be &quot;fully backed by liquid assets,&quot; emphasizing the need to be vigilant against their excessive use on speculative asset trading platforms, which could lead to fraud and systemic risks.</description>

This figure is slightly lower than the prediction on Monday when 72% of bettors forecasted that Bitcoin&apos;s trading price would once again drop below $100,000 this year.Presto Research analyst Min Jung stated: &quot;Up to now, the large-scale sell-offs by whales and long-term holders have encountered sufficient buyer demand - especially from corporate treasuries and institutional allocators.
