      <title>If Ethereum breaks above $4500, the mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation pressure will reach 1.395 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27847</link>
      <description>On September 5th, based on Coinglass data, if Ethereum manages to break through $4500, the total liquidation intensity of the short positions on mainstream CEX will reach $1.395 billion.On the other hand, if Ethereum drops below $4300, the total liquidation intensity of the long positions on mainstream CEX will reach $0.712 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of the contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree reaching a certain price level will have an impact. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that reaching that price will lead to a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>The Strategy&apos;s profitability level has met the S&amp;P 500 inclusion criteria. If included, it will bring in $16 billion in liquidity.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27838</link>
      <description>On September 5th, according to Bloomberg, with regard to Strategy, as it recorded $14 billion in unrealized gains in the last quarter, it has theoretically met the profitability requirement for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500. If included, passive funds tracking the index would be required to passively purchase around 50 million shares, which would amount to approximately $16 billion at the current price. This would lead institutional passive holders to hold around $70 billion of its Bitcoin reserves.Although Strategy had already been included in the Nasdaq 100 by the end of 2024, the S&amp;P 500 has more stringent requirements regarding liquidity, market capitalization (no less than $227 billion), earnings history, and industry balance. The final decision still depends on the committee&apos;s judgment.</description>
