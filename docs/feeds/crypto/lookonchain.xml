      <title>Analysis: Companies like Circle, Stripe, etc., are creating proprietary blockchains to have their own settlement layer, aiming to enhance the efficiency, compliance, and revenue of digital asset pa...</title>

      <description>August 17th. Circle and Stripe are engaged in building their proprietary blockchain, becoming part of an ever-growing number of projects that are aiming to launch stablecoin and asset tokenization chains. Startups Plasma and Stable have recently obtained funds for developing a dedicated chain for USDT. Securitize is collaborating with Ethena to construct Converge. Ondo Finance announced earlier this year about its upcoming native chain. And just a few days ago, Dinari indicated that it will soon launch a layer-1 network powered by Avalanche for the settlement and clearance of tokenized stocks.Cryptocurrency bank Sygnum&apos;s Chief Client Officer Martin Burgherr stated, &quot;Constructing your own L1 is related to control and strategic positioning. The economics of stablecoins are determined by settlement speed, interoperability, and regulatory coordination. Thus, having a foundational layer enables companies to directly embed compliance, integrate forex engines, and ensure predictable fees.&quot;</description>

      <title>LINK Surges Over 13% in 24 Hours, Potentially Driven by LINK&apos;s Reserve Risk and On-Chain Inflows</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24944</link>
      <description>On August 17th, based on HTX market information, LINK surged by more than 13% in the past 24 hours and is currently priced at $24.9125.Chainlink launched the &quot;LINK Reserves Plan&quot; at the beginning of August. It proportionally converts on-chain oracle network revenue and off-chain enterprise service earnings into LINK token reserves. The current reserve size has exceeded one million dollars. In the long term, it will form a supply shock through a continuous buyback mechanism, enhancing the token&apos;s value capture ability.Furthermore, in the past 30 days, LINK has seen a net on-chain inflow of 275,002 tokens ($6.65 million), while CEX reserves have dropped to an 18-month low. Whale holdings have increased from 37% in June to 42%, indicating that institutional-grade funds are accelerating their positions.</description>
