      <title>Greeks.Live: Market Divided on Whether to Enter Bear Market, Overall Sentiment Still Leans Bearish on Short-Term Trend</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25412</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Greeks.Live released the daily market brief, suggesting that the overall market sentiment still tends towards short-term bearish trends. The majority of traders are concentrating on the support range between $110,000 and $108,000, and they believe that this low level may be reached. There is a divergence in the market regarding whether we are entering a bear market. Some community members think that if the price continues to decline next Monday, it will confirm the arrival of a bear market.Mid-September to October is regarded as a potential rebound period. It is expected that a rate cut policy could lead to a market turnaround. From a technical perspective, the BTC weekly MACD is facing the risk of a bearish crossover, similar to the market situation in December last year. The expected adjustment period is around one month.</description>

      <description>August 20th. Analysts have stated that the price trend of Bitcoin is increasingly resembling the outcome of intentional manipulation. BTC touched its lowest level since August 3rd due to continuous selling pressure from the United States. As the US stock market opened today, Bitcoin fell below $113,000 and failed to maintain the support level. The buying liquidity on trading platforms is being depleted, and $112,300 has now become a level worthy of attention.Well-known trader Daan Crypto Trades summarized the current Bitcoin liquidity situation, indicating that BTC has cleared a substantial amount of liquidity from both the long and short sides within the past 6 weeks. Currently, the closest large liquidity is concentrated around $120,000, but the local low point at $112,000 remains effective and often turns into a local reversal area.Renowned trader and analyst Rekt Capital issued a bullish signal by comparing the current price trend to previous bull market pullbacks. &quot;The most bu</description>
