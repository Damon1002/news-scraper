      <title>Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin Expected to Test $100,000, Ethereum to Test $3,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22897</link>
      <description>On August 2nd, Arthur Hayes gave a response regarding the recent profit-taking activities on social media. He stated, &quot;The U.S. tariff relief program is set to expire in the third quarter... at least, this is how the market perceives it following the release of the non-farm payroll data. Currently, major economies have not been able to generate credit at a sufficient pace to boost nominal GDP. Therefore, Bitcoin will undergo a test at $100,000, and Ethereum will be tested at $3,000. For more details, please attend my keynote speech at WebX Asia in Tokyo on August 25th. I am now going to take some time to relax.&quot;It was previously reported by BlockBeats that Arthur Hayes sold 2,373 ETH ($8.32 million), 7.76 million ENA ($4.62 million), and 38.86 billion PEPE ($41,470) earlier today.</description>
