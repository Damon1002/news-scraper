      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4400, the total Long Liquidation on major CEXs will reach $1.191 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24645</link>
      <description>On August 15th, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum drops below $4400, the total liquidation strength of mainstream CEXs in terms of long positions will reach $1.191 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum surges above $4700, the total liquidation strength of mainstream CEXs in terms of short positions will reach $928 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the contracts to be liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring liquidation clusters, that is, the strength.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the target price will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will have a more intense reaction due to a surge in liquidity when it reaches that level.</description>

      <title>The US Banking Industry Calls for Amendment to the GENIUS Act Signed by Trump, Warning of Potential Financial Risks</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24644</link>
      <description>August 14th. According to The Block, the largest banking association in the US is advising senators to fill what it deems as loopholes in the stablecoin legislation signed by President Trump last month. It is stated that these loopholes may pose a threat to the broader financial system.This week, the American Bankers Association (ABA) along with 52 other banking organizations sent a letter to the leadership of the Senate Banking Committee, suggesting revisions to the American Stablecoin Guidance and Establishment of a National Innovation in U.S. Act (GENIUS).

      <title>Federal Reserve&apos;s Mester: It&apos;s Too Early to Decide on September Rate Decision</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24640</link>
      <description>August 14th: Mester from the Federal Reserve indicated that it is still too soon to determine whether to cut interest rates during the next month&apos;s meeting. When queried about whether there is a reason to cut rates by 50 basis points next month, Mester remarked that, in his view, this would be &quot;not justified by the current economic conditions and economic outlook.&quot; Mester referred to the fact that, on one hand, &quot;the data is beginning to provide us with certain indications regarding the possibility of sustained inflation.&quot;Meanwhile, he alluded to the &quot;downside risks to the labor market.&quot; Mester stated that the U.S. economic growth is decelerating, along with tariffs exerting pressure on corporate profit margins, which could pose a threat to the robust labor market performance witnessed thus far. He said: &quot;I am weighing these two factors, and when we encounter tensions between the two objectives, we need to adopt a balanced approach.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
