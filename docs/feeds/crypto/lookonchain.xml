      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22689</link>
      <description>On July 31st, BODL Ventures Partner Liu Feng, as a guest on BlockBeats&apos; &quot;Content Coin: Hype, Hope, or the Second Spring of Creator Economy?&quot; themed Space, expressed that the vision of content coins should not be confined to the present. In the future, there may be an explosive period during which billions of tokens are issued daily. This can be described with a popular term as &quot;emergence&quot;, similar to how AI suddenly made breakthroughs during continuous &quot;emergence&quot;. Perhaps by then, all new content creation, new forms, new modes of dissemination, and the so-called use cases will truly emerge. At present, we should bravely envision this scenario, which may shatter all our imaginations. Looking back at the nearly 30-year evolution of the internet, it was the same. It&apos;s not that the current content is too poor; it&apos;s that we haven&apos;t created enough. A miracle can happen when we go all out. Without quantitative change, where does qualitative change come from? Quantity change is the best carri</description>

      <title>NAVI Team Carl: The average survival period of an AI Content Token is 5 to 6 months, and its ultimate survival depends on actual use case.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22685</link>
      <description>On July 31st, Carl, the business director of NAVI Protocol, who was a guest on BlockBeats&apos; &quot;Content Coin: Hype, Hope, or the Second Spring of Creator Economy?&quot; themed Space, stated that from 2023 to 2024, the average lifespan of all AI concept projects is only approximately 5 to 6 months. AI content tokens are prone to being hyped, but in order to survive in the long term, they need to be provided with a use case. The question of whether AI content has value ultimately depends on how to add more functionality to the AI token itself, and real-world use cases are a way out for AI content tokens.Ongoing Space: https://x.com/i/spaces/1vAxRDOWWqkGl</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrency and AI Researcher Wang Chao: Content Tokens should be explored, but the success rate of highly speculative tokens is questionable</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22682</link>
      <description>July 31st, Cryptocurrency and AI researcher Wang Chao, as a guest on BlockBeats&apos; &quot;Content Coin: Hype, Hope, or Second Spring of Creator Economy?&quot; themed Space, expressed his viewpoints. He stated that some AI-generated content is undoubtedly valuable. Nevertheless, the value of packaging AI-generated content into tokens remains questionable and depends on whether the generated content is valuable. All data itself has asset attributes, but this value is difficult to measure within the traditional price system. It is not denied that content tokens should be explored, and some content tokens are valuable. However, there is a strong doubt regarding the probability of success for a highly speculative token.Ongoing Space: https://x.com/i/spaces/1vAxRDOWWqkGl</description>
