      <title>Wang Feng: Cryptographic Assets Such as Bitcoin and Ethereum Will Become Anchors for Fundraising by Funds and Institutions</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24357</link>
      <description>On August 13th, Wang Feng, the founder of LightHash, mentioned in a post that cryptocurrency is having a profound impact on the financial industry, encompassing banks, asset management companies, and VCs. It is not merely about retail investors holding assets such as Ethereum; rather, it is about a structural consensus taking shape in the financial market. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and perhaps even XRP are likely to become the anchor assets for many funds and institutional fundraising. Traditional fund managers and General Partners (GPs) are currently altering their viewpoints, and it is still not too late to actively engage.</description>

      <title>Santiment: Ethereum Retail Traders Continue to Sell Off During ETH Price Surge</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24351</link>
      <description>On August 13th, the cryptocurrency market analysis firm Santiment declared that &quot;Ethereum is currently merely 6.4% away from its historical high of $4,891 on November 16, 2021. During Ethereum&apos;s upward movement, retail traders have been constantly offloading. &quot;In history, price trends often go against the expectations of retail traders. On June 16, 2025, and July 30, extreme greed sentiment emerged, resulting in price corrections. Nevertheless, as the asset price continuously reaches new highs, traders have exhibited panic (FUD) and doubts.Currently, major stakeholders are accumulating Ethereum chips that retail traders are willing to sell, and the price shows almost no resistance from market sentiment, suggesting that Ethereum is likely to break through soon and set a new all-time high.</description>
