The second season will return once we have addressed the fundamental issue of &quot;how to maintain quality at scale&quot; and ensure that &quot;attention optimization&quot; does not revert to the &quot;noise farm&quot; that we were trying to eliminate.The reward pool of the first season is approximately 1.5 billion Î¼Patrons, and users who have been</description>
