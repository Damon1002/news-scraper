      <title>Federal Reserve Governor Powell to Sue Trump for Firing Him as Early as Today</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26501</link>
      <description>On August 27th, as per CNBC, sources disclosed that a Federal Reserve Board member, Lisa Cook, is scheduled to file a lawsuit as early as today (in connection with Trump&apos;s dismissal).BlockBeats reported yesterday that U.S. President Trump signed a document removing the Federal Reserve Board member Cook from office with immediate effect. In the document, Trump stated: &quot;By the authority vested in me by Article II of the U.S. Constitution and the amended 1913 Federal Reserve Act, I hereby dismiss Cook from the Board of the Federal Reserve System. Given Cook&apos;s lack of honesty in financial matters and potential engagement in criminal activities, I cannot have confidence in your integrity. At the very least, these actions demonstrate serious negligence in your financial transactions, raising doubts about your ability and credibility as a financial regulator.&quot;</description>

      <title>BiyaPay Analyst: BTC Monthly Drop Mainly due to ETF Outflows</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26492</link>
      <description>On August 27th, the analysis by BiyaPay pointed out that the price decline of BTC this month is associated with the outflows of ETF funds. In order to welcome a potential bull market by the end of the year, a large amount of fund inflow is required.In January 2024, 11 physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs were listed on NASDAQ, enabling investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without having to self-custody the coins. Since then, these funds have cumulatively attracted $53.9 billion in investment.However, these funds recorded a net outflow of $972 million this month, which is the second largest since their inception, second only to February&apos;s $3.56 billion. If the data on Friday still shows a net outflow, it will mark the end of a four-month trend of fund inflows.</description>
