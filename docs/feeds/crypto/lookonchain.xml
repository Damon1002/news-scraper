      <description>On September 8th, Sam Kazemian, the founder of Frax, stated in a social media post that the key insight of the Hyperliquid USDH event is that the true value of a stablecoin issuer lies in the interoperability and deep integration of the economic distribution chain rather than the obtainable sovereign bond yield.He stated that candidate parties, including Frax and Paxos, are willing to return 100% of the yield to Hyperliquid, but the actual value should far exceed yield sharing.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/28092</link>
      <description>September 8th. According to crypto KOL AB Kuai.Dong, the Korean trader NAMSEOKHEE, who previously went long on 107 meme coins simultaneously on Binance Futures and exited after a meme season bet went awry, has made a comeback. NAMSEOKHEE has initiated 56 meme long contract positions from last weekend to this morning, once again betting on the arrival of the meme season. This operation has transformed his overall position from a loss to a gain. In comparison to before, this time his strategy is more cautious:- For most meme coins, the margin is only $300 to $600;- Still employing cross 20x leverage;- Only for a few meme coins in which he is particularly bullish, he has raised the margin to $2500 and will hold the position without taking profits.</description>
