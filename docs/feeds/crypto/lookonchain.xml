      <title>European Central Bank President: EU Should Address Stablecoin Regulation Gaps</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27506</link>
      <description>On Wednesday, September 3rd, European Central Bank President Lagarde stated that EU lawmakers should demand that foreign stablecoin issuers implement &quot;safeguards&quot; and a &quot;robust equivalent regulatory regime&quot; in order to prevent the risk of reserve run within the EU.During a regulatory meeting, she said: &quot;European legislation should ensure that such schemes cannot operate within the EU unless they have strong support from equivalent regimes in other jurisdictions and safeguard measures related to asset transfers between EU and non-EU entities.&quot;She also added: &quot;This further emphasizes why international cooperation is essential. Without a fair global regulatory environment, risks will always find the weakest link.&quot; (Golden Finance)</description>
