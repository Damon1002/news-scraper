      <title>Federal Reserve&apos;s Mester: It&apos;s Too Early to Decide on September Rate Decision</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24640</link>
      <description>August 14th: Mester from the Federal Reserve indicated that it is still too soon to determine whether to cut interest rates during the next month&apos;s meeting. When queried about whether there is a reason to cut rates by 50 basis points next month, Mester remarked that, in his view, this would be &quot;not justified by the current economic conditions and economic outlook.&quot; Mester referred to the fact that, on one hand, &quot;the data is beginning to provide us with certain indications regarding the possibility of sustained inflation.&quot;Meanwhile, he alluded to the &quot;downside risks to the labor market.&quot; Mester stated that the U.S. economic growth is decelerating, along with tariffs exerting pressure on corporate profit margins, which could pose a threat to the robust labor market performance witnessed thus far. He said: &quot;I am weighing these two factors, and when we encounter tensions between the two objectives, we need to adopt a balanced approach.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
