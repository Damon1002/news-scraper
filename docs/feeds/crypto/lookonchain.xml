      <title>If Bitcoin surpasses $114,000, the total short liquidation volume on major CEXs will reach $847 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27868</link>
      <description>On September 5th, according to Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $114,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $847 million.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $111,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $1.416 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts that have been liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent reaching a particular price level will have an impact. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that once the price reaches that level, a more intense reaction will occur due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>Omni Network has announced a rebrand to Nomina, with a 1:75 OMNI to new coin NOM ratio.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27867</link>
      <description>On September 5th, the Ethereum interoperability protocol Omni Network made an announcement about its rebranding to Nomina. It presented a new name, logo, visual identity, and a brand-new product narrative to showcase its future direction.As part of this rebranding process, the Omni team is currently engaged in developing an application for token migration. Currently, existing OMNI holders and stakers do not need to take any actions. It should also be noted that the new ticker symbol for Nomina&apos;s token will be NOM. After the rebranding, NOM will become the primary token on the network (Smart Contract: 0x6e6F6d696e61decd6605bD4a57836c5DB6923340), replacing OMNI.The ratio between OMNI and NOM is 1:75. This implies that at the time of launch, the circulating supply will be 2.9 billion NOM. Based on the tokenomics plan from the previous $OMNI TGE, the total supply will be 7.5 billion NOM. Since we aim to provide all community members with the opportunity to migrate to NOM at their own c</description>

      <title>Ethereum Foundation Completes Partial Sell-off, Withdraws 3.387M DAI from CEX</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27866</link>
      <description>September 5th. Based on @EmberCN&apos;s monitoring, the Ethereum Foundation transferred 10,000 ETH to Kraken for sale the day before yesterday. 20 minutes ago, they withdrew 3.387 million DAI from Kraken. &quot;This indicates that a portion of these 10,000 ETH has already been sold.&quot;BlockBeats previously reported that the Ethereum Foundation announced in a blog post that during the course of several weeks this month, they would be converting 10,000 ETH through a centralized exchange to continuously support development, grants, and donations. These conversions would be carried out through multiple small orders rather than completing a large transaction all at once.</description>

      <title>BiyaPay Analyst: Nasdaq Tightens Cryptocurrency Stock Regulation, New Stock Purchase with Coins Requires Shareholder Approval, Institutional Bull Market Fear Likely to End</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27865</link>
      <description>On September 5th, Nasdaq is enhancing its regulation of public companies&apos; cryptocurrency purchases by means of new stock issuance. It requires some companies to obtain shareholder approval before making a purchase. This action is likely to slow down the current cryptocurrency craze and offer investors more transparency regarding risks.As of now, 124 US-listed companies have planned to raise more than $133 billion to purchase cryptocurrency, and the vast majority of them are listed on Nasdaq. In recent years, some companies have adopted a strategy similar to that of MicroStrategy, rapidly accumulating Bitcoin and other tokens in an attempt to boost their stock prices. However, with Nasdaq introducing shareholder voting and approval requirements, such funding operations may face the risk of delays or even adjustments to the transaction structure.For instance, the Nasdaq-listed company Heritage Distilling plans to purchase Story blockchain native tokens. Due to Nasdaq&apos;s new rule, its</description>

      <title>The U.S. labor market is experiencing a &quot;speed bump moment,&quot; with next week&apos;s job revisions potentially reaching 800,000.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27862</link>
      <description>September 5th. If the market&apos;s prediction that there will be tepid US job growth in August and the unemployment rate will rise to 4.3% turns out to be correct, it will verify the weakness in the labor market and definitely settle the matter regarding the Fed&apos;s rate cut this month. Currently, US job growth appears to have entered a &quot;stall&quot; stage. Economists attribute this to President Trump&apos;s comprehensive import tariffs and immigration crackdown, which have reduced the labor force participation. The weakness in the labor market is mainly on the hiring side.Economists anticipate that nonfarm payrolls will increase by 75,000 last month, as compared to the 73,000 increase in July. Earlier, the job data for May and June were revised downwards by a total of 258,000, which angered Trump last month. Trump used this as a reason to dismiss the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of manipulating jobs data.When the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its p</description>
