      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4200, the mainstream CEX long liquidation pressure will reach $1.103 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26898</link>
      <description>On August 29th, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum drops below $4200, the total liquidation strength of the long positions on mainstream CEXs will reach $1.103 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum breaks through $4450, the total liquidation strength of the short positions on mainstream CEXs will reach $680 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not provide a precise display of the number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of the contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to nearby liquidation clusters, that is, the strength. Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the price of the underlying asset will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that when the price is reached, it will experience a stronger reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
