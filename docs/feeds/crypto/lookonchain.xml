      <title>If Bitcoin breaches $117,000, the mainstream CEX total short liquidation volume will reach $5.58 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24996</link>
      <description>On August 18th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $117,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will reach 558 million.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEX will reach 690 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not disclose the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the target price will be influenced when it reaches a particular position. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity avalanche once it reaches that specific point.</description>
