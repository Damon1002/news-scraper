      <title>Hyperliquid Response to XPL Price Surge: The platform has not experienced any technical issues or defaults. Users are advised to be aware of the risks themselves.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26483</link>
      <description>On August 27th, Hyperliquid&apos;s official announcement on the Discord channel stated that today, the XPL market witnessed significant volatility. The token price surged by approximately 2.5 times within a few minutes. During this period, the Hyperliquid blockchain operated normally as designed and there were no technical issues.

Hyperp adopts a fully isolated margin system where the PnL of all users is isolated from other asset positions. This liquidation and ADL only affected XPL positions, and the protocol did not incur any bad debts.The pre-market itself is unpredictable. The robust mark price formula used by Hyperp effectively prevents instantaneous price spikes.

      <title>Trend Research: ETH Institutional Demand Far Outstrips Stake Supply, ETH Market Cap Expected to Surpass BTC Across Next 1-2 Bull-Bear Cycles</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26480</link>
      <description>August 27th. In its most recent report, Trend Research, a secondary investment institution affiliated with LD Capital, stated: &quot;From a supply and demand standpoint, the current institutional consensus-driven demand for ETH significantly exceeds the supply from staking. We believe that the long-term fully loaded staking situation is not viable. Considering the continued implementation of crypto-friendly policies in the future and Wall Street reaching a consensus on the long-term value of ETH, the &apos;buying craze&apos; for ETH has merely begun. With the approaching halving cycle, we are raising our long-term target price for ETH and think that ETH&apos;s market capitalization will surpass BTC&apos;s within 1-2 bull-bear cycles.&quot;</description>
