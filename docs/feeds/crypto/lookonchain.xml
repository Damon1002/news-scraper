      <title>Arkham: 45,000 BTC Found Untouched by German Government, Potentially Still Controlled by Movie2K Operator</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27945</link>
      <description>On September 6th, Arkham announced via social media that the organization has located 5 billion dollars&apos; worth of Bitcoin that the German government failed to confiscate.Previously, in early 2024, the German police seized 49,858 bitcoins from the operator of the video piracy website Movie2K. In July 2024, these bitcoins were sold at an average price of $57,900, resulting in a profit of $2.89 billion.However, Arkham&apos;s research uncovered another Bitcoin cluster associated with Movie2K&apos;s early operations. This cluster consists of approximately 45,000 bitcoins (worth $4.99 billion) and has not been moved since 2019. These bitcoins are stored in more than 100 Bitcoin wallets and are likely still under the control of the Movie2K operator. The scale of this batch is almost equivalent to the seized bitcoins.The German government&apos;s statement did not mention this additional batch of bitcoins and did not incorporate them into the initial &quot;emergency sale&quot; plan.</description>
