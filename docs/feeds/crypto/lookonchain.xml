      <title>Matrixport: Current Crypto Concept Stock Institutional Participation is Insufficient, Stock Price May Further Consolidate in the Short Term</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25330</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Matrixport released a new report on social media. It stated that following a strong 18-month rally, crypto concept stocks have entered a consolidation phase. During the past 18 months, the crypto concept stock index has outperformed Bitcoin significantly. However, with the recent pullbacks in the stock prices of leading companies like MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and Metaplanet, the index has started to show signs of a correction. The cooling of buying interest after Circle&apos;s listing further confirms the lack of momentum in the new stock market.Analyst Markus Thielen said that the current low institutional participation may reflect the seasonal weakness in summer. Without the support of major crypto IPOs, prices may further consolidate in the short term.</description>

      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Support Located in $109,600 to $106,800 High Demand Zone</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25327</link>
      <description>On August 20th, CryptoQuant analyst Axel posted on social media, indicating that this pullback is relatively gentle. Bitcoin has only dropped by 8% from its local peak. The mid-term support is at the 111-day moving average ($109,600), and the short-term holder realized price is ($106,800). This area forms a dense area of demand, and it is anticipated that there will be attempts at stabilization and a rebound in this zone.</description>

      <title>Analysis: The U.S. Treasury is set to withdraw $500-600 billion in cash from the market over the next two months, potentially leading to increased market illiquidity.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25326</link>
      <description>August 20th. The Delphi Digital Market Research Institute put out an article indicating that in the forthcoming weeks, the US Treasury Department will commence replenishing its General Account (TGA). This process will withdraw $500–600 billion in cash from the market over approximately two months. On the surface, this might seem ordinary. However, the current period is evolving into one of the most fragile liquidity environments of the past decade.In 2023, the $550 billion TGA replenishment was cushioned by more than $2 trillion of Fed reverse repo tools, healthy bank reserves, and strong overseas bond demand. Now, these cushions have disappeared. The Fed is still consuming liquidity through Quantitative Tightening (QT). Reverse repos are almost depleted. Banks are restricted by losses and capital rules. Overseas buyers from China to Japan have also withdrawn. As a result, every dollar raised by the Treasury Department this fall will be directly drawn from active market liquidity.H</description>

      <title>Institution: Powell to Open Door to September Rate Cut at Jackson Hole</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25324</link>
      <description>On August 20th, MainSky Asset Management Company declared that Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is likely to open the door to a rate cut in September during the upcoming Jackson Hole Symposium. The chairman of the MainSky Board, Eckhard Schulte, stated that, in contrast to last year&apos;s meeting when Powell prepared the market for a 50-basis-point rate cut, this time the cut is anticipated to be only 25 basis points. He pointed out: &quot;Unlike last year, the current monetary policy is closer to the &apos;neutral rate,&apos; thus there is no requirement for a rapid and significant rate hike to achieve normalization.&quot; MainSky anticipates that there will be at least one more rate cut in the fourth quarter of this year.

      <title>If Bitcoin surpasses $115,000, the mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation pressure will reach $1.122 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25322</link>
      <description>On August 20th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $115,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $1.122 billion.On the other hand, if Bitcoin drops below $112,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $882 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the underlying price will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>Analysis: The main force behind this round of Ethereum short selling is suspected to be a hedge fund</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25321</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Ethereum recently experienced a significant surge and reached nearly $5,000, which triggered a bullish rally. Nevertheless, this crucial level was not successfully broken through as sellers once again took the upper hand and forced the price to decline. A considerable amount of the downward pressure seems to originate from large hedge funds that continue to have heavy short positions in the second-largest cryptocurrency.When the Ethereum price exceeded $4,000, the number of short positions also started to rise. Many market participants expected the upward momentum to weaken. A large number of these short positions were led by major hedge funds, further intensifying the downward pressure on Ethereum. This is not an isolated incident as hedge funds have been trying to suppress the ETH price in an attempt to reduce their own losses.According to The Block&apos;s &quot;CME Ether Futures Net Position&quot; dashboard, these short positions have reached a historic high. Only hedge funds s</description>
