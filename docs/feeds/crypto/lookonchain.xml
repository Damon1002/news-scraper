      <description>August 8th, Economist and cryptocurrency critic Peter Schiff tweeted, &quot;Most Americans possess far too little savings to sustain their retirement.

      <title>Ethereum Foundation Executive Director: Greater Emphasis Should Be Placed on Any Potential Delay in the Fusaka Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23656</link>
      <description>On August 8th, Tomasz K. Sta≈Ñczak, the Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation, tweeted, &quot;The Glamsterdam Upgrade (Q1/Q2 2026) might draw some attention. However, at the same time, we should place more emphasis on any potential delays to the Fusaka Upgrade (Q4 2025). As I have repeatedly stated, if we are unable to achieve a consistent level of coordination to meet milestones on time, then discussing Ethereum&apos;s roadmap and vision becomes meaningless. I am aware that some very talented individuals are working hard to address the issues that are causing the proposed changes to the team&apos;s dates. I hope to see widespread acknowledgment that the timeline is of great importance. Of great importance.&quot;</description>
