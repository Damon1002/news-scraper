      <title>Bitget Research Institute: ETH/BTC Ratio Breaks Above 200-day Moving Average for the First Time, ETH Expected to Rally to $10,000 in Q4</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22138</link>
      <description>On July 28th, Ryan Lee, the chief analyst of the Bitget Research Institute, stated that Ethereum has recently surged by nearly 60% and exceeded $3,800. This is mainly driven by institutional fund inflows and the increase in on-chain activities, showing clear signs of structural strength. It is worth noting that the ETH/BTC ratio has surpassed the 200-day moving average for the first time in a year, indicating that Ethereum is entering a relatively strong period.Last week, the net inflow of ETH-related spot and derivative transactions reached $2.4 billion, and large whale addresses on-chain have continued to accumulate. At the same time, the market&apos;s expectations for the Ethereum ecosystem, especially core applications such as DeFi, continue to heat up, driving a structural shift of funds towards ETH. In contrast, although Bitcoin has been stably trading above $119,000 and still has a robust technical aspect and some institutional support, ETF funds have seen slight outflows.

      <title>QCP: Market Expecting Ethereum and Bitcoin to Face Pullback Pressure Around $4,000 and $120,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22137</link>
      <description>On July 28th, QCP issued its daily market analysis report indicating that Ethereum is gradually getting close to the $4000 price level, which was last observed in December of the previous year. With the continuous inflow of funds into the Ethereum spot ETF surpassing that of the Bitcoin ETF for seven consecutive days, market attention and speculation on ETH are intensifying. Considering that the market value of ETH is currently only one-fifth of that of BTC, the threshold for attracting institutional and corporate funds is relatively lower, making the price action more sensitive.Although Ethereum has been dominating most of the headlines in recent weeks, Bitcoin has shown quiet resilience. Although the inflow of funds into the Bitcoin spot ETF has slowed down, the price trend remains stable.Bitcoin&apos;s dominance rate still remains around 60%, with almost no fluctuation in the past week, reflecting the market&apos;s long-term confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value asset rather than a wi</description>

      <title>Trader Eugene: The current market is experiencing widespread FOMO sentiment, trading requires noise cancellation</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22133</link>
      <description>On July 28th, trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio put up on his personal channel and said, &quot;We are now in a market exuberance stage - Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is widespread. Major Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) are showing off their profit achievements, trying to get you to join their paid groups. Everything seems to be like easy money.&quot;At this moment, the best approach is to filter out the noise on social media and focus on your own pace and goals. Your true opponent is only yourself. Comparison will only take away all your joy.</description>
