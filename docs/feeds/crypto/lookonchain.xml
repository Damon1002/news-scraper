      <title>AguilaTrades has closed a long position, realizing a profit of $11.3 million</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23860</link>
      <description>August 9th. Based on EmberCN&apos;s monitoring, the whale contract trader AguilaTrades closed his long positions on BTC and ETH just 10 minutes ago, completing a trade that lasted only 2 days. During this long position, he expanded his initial $4.6 million capital to $15.9 million, thereby achieving a $11.3 million profit.Previously, AguilaTrades had witnessed substantial unrealized gains after opening positions, but each time he decided to compound those gains, which led to higher leverage. Minor retracements ate away at the gains, and eventually, he lost his initial capital. After this $11.3 million profit, AguilaTrades&apos; total losses have been reduced from $40 million to $28.7 million.</description>
