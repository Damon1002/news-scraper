      <title>Tom Lee: Historic Opportunity Unfolding in the Ethereum Ecosystem, Poised to Witness Unprecedented Wave of Innovation</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25075</link>
      <description>On August 18th, Tom Lee, the newly appointed Chairman of the Board of BitMine, stated in a post on Design Media that when the United States abandoned the gold standard in 1971, many people focused on gold. However, the real winner was Wall Street. With the vigorous development of the trading system and financial infrastructure, the modern financial landscape was established.Today, with the progress of the White House&apos;s &quot;GENIUS Act&quot; and the SEC&apos;s &quot;Project Crypto&quot;, a similar historical opportunity is emerging within the Ethereum ecosystem. When this digital financial infrastructure is in place, we will witness an unprecedented wave of innovation.</description>
