      <title>Opinion: Ethereum ETF Sees Record Single-Day Net Outflow, Signaling Short-Term Profit Taking, Not Institutional Waning</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23210</link>
      <description>August 5th. In relation to yesterday&apos;s largest single-day net outflow of a U.S. Ethereum spot ETF, Nick Ruck, the research director of LVRG, stated: &quot;Although this might suggest profit-taking following ETH&apos;s recent price surge, it does not necessarily imply a decline in institutional demand. Particularly when considering the industry&apos;s record $5.4 billion inflow in July and the corporate accumulation of ETH.&quot;Vincent Liu, the chief information officer of Kronos Research, also holds a similar view. &quot;This trend reflects short-term profit-taking and the fluctuation of risk aversion sentiment rather than a rejection of long-term ETH holdings.&quot; (The Block)</description>

      <title>Meme Market Watch: New Coin DUMP on Solana, Bucky Market Cap Surges Temporarily, Base Chain NET and QR See Increased Trading Activity</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23212</link>
      <description>August 5th. According to GMGN data, within the past 6 hours on the Solana blockchain in the &quot;Next Blue Chip&quot; sector, the top five tokens in terms of market capitalization are PUMP, MarsMi, DUMP, Ani, and Bucky. Here, DUMP has been listed for less than 24 hours. It has a low trading volume and either has fewer than a thousand holding addresses or poses significant risks.On the other hand, on the Base chain, in the past 24 hours, the top five tokens by trading volume released on Clanker are BNKR, CLANKER, Fartcoin, NET, and QR. The latter two are newly on the list and have been performing exceptionally well these days.BlockBeats reminds users that Meme coins often lack practical use cases and experience significant price volatility.

      <title>HTX DeepThink: Fed&apos;s Unwillingness to Provide Clear Guidance on Easing Triggers Short-Term Market Shock, &quot;Collapse&quot; in Employment Data Prompts Reassessment of Rate Cut Expectations</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23209</link>
      <description>On August 5th, HTX DeepThink columnist and HTX Research researcher Chloe (@ChloeTalk1) pointed out in her analysis that during the July FOMC meeting, the interest rate was kept at 5.25%â€“5.50% and no guidance was provided on future interest rate cuts, which triggered market concerns about &quot;sustaining high interest rates for a longer period.&quot; Subsequently, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield rose to 4.24%, the U.S. dollar index returned above 100, gold fell below $3,270, and Bitcoin retraced to the $116,000 range in the short term. Meanwhile, on-chain activity also decreased synchronously.The July non-farm payroll report unexpectedly saw a &quot;cliff-like decline&quot;: only 73,000 new jobs were added, falling short of the expected 180,000. Moreover, the employment data for May and June were revised downward by about 90% in total. The reality of a &quot;systemic overestimation&quot; of the labor market promptly led the market to quickly reassess the Fed&apos;s policy path. As a result, the CME FedWatch inter</description>

      <title>Analysis: Amid escalating inflation concerns, the options market is showing bearish pre-signals.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23206</link>
      <description>On August 5th, as per CoinDesk, worries regarding the economy, such as rising inflation and disappointing job figures, have resulted in a recent price decline of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, with indicators in the options market indicating a shift in market sentiment, Bitcoin&apos;s long-term bullish sentiment has transformed into a neutral one.Griffin Ardern, the Director of Options Trading and Research at the crypto financial platform BloFin, stated, &quot;I have noticed a rather worrying sign of a recent market retracement. The bullish sentiment for Bitcoin&apos;s far-month options has vanished and is currently firmly in a neutral position. This implies that the options market believes that BTC is unlikely to establish a long-term upward trend, and the probability of reaching new highs in the coming months is decreasing, similar to what occurred in January and February 2022.&quot;</description>

      <title>Matrixport: The current surge of altcoins may be difficult to sustain, and market sentiment still needs to be observed</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23203</link>
      <description>August 5th. Matrixport shared today&apos;s market views as follows: Despite the continuous hype in the market regarding the &quot;altcoin bull run,&quot; there have only been two brief rebound rounds up to now, which were concentrated on a few projects. The overall market lacks sustainability. Although there was a phased activity in the fourth quarter of 2024, it did not lead to widespread diffusion.Overall, the rebound lacks fundamental support, making it difficult to drive the market into a sustained upward momentum. Matrixport remains cautious and believes that this round of gains may be difficult to maintain. The rapid drop in funding rates also indicates that bullish sentiment has not effectively converged, and market enthusiasm is still under observation.</description>
