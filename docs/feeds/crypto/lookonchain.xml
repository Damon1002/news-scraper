      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Can Hedge Against Selling Pressure on US Bonds</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27028</link>
      <description>August 31st. As per CoinDesk, André Dragosch, the European Research Director at Bitwise Asset Management, mentioned that when the stock market is in a downturn, gold serves as the most effective hedge. Meanwhile, Bitcoin demonstrates more resilience when the U.S. bond market is under pressure. Historical data and industry research also back this perspective: gold generally rises during stock market bear markets, while Bitcoin performs better during U.S. Treasury sell-offs.By 2025, the price of gold has increased by more than 30%, and Bitcoin has risen by approximately 16.46%. This reflects the significantly different roles that the two assets play when investors consider rising yields, stock market volatility, and Trump&apos;s support for cryptocurrency.</description>
