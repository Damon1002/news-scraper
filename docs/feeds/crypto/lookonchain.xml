      <title>SharpLink CEO: Ethereum is the Wall Street of Capital, combining Productivity, Profitability, and Programmability</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27410</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, Joseph Chalom, the Co-CEO of SharpLink which is the second-largest treasury company in Ethereum, published an article to explain why ETH is favored by Wall Street capital. He stated that Ethereum is the place where capital wants to go. With 10 years of continuous operation, it ensures the storage of trillions of dollars in value. At the same time, the new foundation leadership is making significant progress at the L1 level. Therefore, SharpLink is very optimistic about the entire Ethereum ecosystem, including L1 and L2, believing that it will attract capital attention. Since Ethereum on-chain transactions are secure and ongoing, SharpLink believes that ETH is a high-quality treasury asset - the world&apos;s first truly trusted commodity with productivity, profitability, programmability and is rapidly becoming a core institutional digital asset.</description>
