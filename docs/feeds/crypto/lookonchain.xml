      <title>Institution: Any dovish suggestions for September could potentially boost Bitcoin&apos;s price</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22530</link>
      <description>On July 31st, Matthew Sigel, the Director of Digital Asset Research at VanEck, stated that &quot;Bitcoin serves as a hedge against currency depreciation. If the Federal Reserve hints at adopting a more dovish policy stance in the future, the cryptocurrency market is likely to interpret it as a green light.&quot;LMAX Group&apos;s Market Strategist, Joel Kruger, said that &quot;All eyes will be focused on the Federal Reserve and the upcoming cryptocurrency policy report from the White House. Any dovish tone from the Federal Reserve or hints from the White House regarding the strategic purchase of Bitcoin reserves could quickly reverse Bitcoin&apos;s recent weakness.&quot;</description>

      <title>Opinion: The Fed is considering a rate cut, but it needs to see a slowdown in employment data to &quot;give the green light.&quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22528</link>
      <description>On July 31st, the market almost unanimously held the view that the Federal Reserve would maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% to 4.5% today. However, there is a divergence in the market&apos;s perspective on the subsequent policy path.Jefferies Chief Economist Mohit Kumar stated: &quot;In our opinion, the Fed intends to reduce rates from the current level. Nevertheless, it still needs to &apos;give the green light&apos; based on indications of a slowdown in employment data. Once the employment data shows weakness, they will initiate rate cuts.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
