      <title>Yi Lihua: The future decade of the crypto industry is still the greatest opportunity for the average person. Long-term bullishness is the key to growth and success.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24728</link>
      <description>On August 15th, the founder of Liquid Capital (formerly LD Capital), Li Huayi, posted on the X Platform, stating: &quot;In the past decade, the crypto industry has been the greatest opportunity for ordinary people, and it will continue to be so in the next decade. Do not let short-term thinking mislead the long-term trend. I come from a rural area, and both of my parents are illiterate. After earning my first bucket of gold through entrepreneurship, I invested in tech companies while going all-in on the crypto industry. Looking back at 2015, none of these decisions seemed reliable at that time, but now it has been proved that they were all correct (although a substantial tuition fee was paid during the investment/trading/management process). Only by having a long-term bullish view can one achieve exponential growth and harvest.&quot;</description>

      <title>Bitunix Analyst: PPI Surges Above Expectations; BTC Sees Short-Term Decline and Holds Firm at $117,900, Caution Required Against Pullback Risk</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24721</link>
      <description>August 15th: On August 15th, the US July PPI increased by 0.9% month-on-month and 3.3% year-on-year. Service and trade profits drove up prices, and there is a mixed interpretation regarding the high probability of a significant rate cut in September. Treasury Secretary Besent gave a speech on the &quot;neutral interest rate,&quot; which intensified policy uncertainty. The risk appetite of cryptocurrencies remains weak, and the trend is shifting towards a range-bound market.Bitunix Analyst Recommendation:The daily chart of BTC previously broke through a downtrend line and surged to 124.5k and then pulled back. The current price is above 119k, with 116,300 serving as the daily bullish/bearish watershed. The heat map shows 119,625, exhibiting a &quot;magnetic&quot; effect, with supply concentrated in the range of 124,600â€“126,800.
