      <title>If Ethereum breaks above $4400, the mainstream CEX total short liquidation volume will reach $1.495 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24139</link>
      <description>On August 12th, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum manages to break through $4400, the cumulative short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will amount to $1.495 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum drops below $4200, the cumulative long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs will reach $335 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of contracts to be liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the target price will be influenced when it reaches a particular level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, there will be a more intense reaction due to a surge in liquidity.</description>
