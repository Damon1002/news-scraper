      <title>The US dollar edged slightly lower but traded in a range-bound manner as investors patiently awaited the US CPI data.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24009</link>
      <description>On August 11th, the US dollar saw a slight decline but remained within a narrow trading range as investors were awaiting the release of the US Consumer Price Index inflation data on Tuesday. In the previous week, the US dollar fell due to the recent weak employment data and Mester&apos;s temporary appointment to the Federal Reserve Board, which increased the possibility of a rate cut in the near future.However, the data on Tuesday may offer early indications of US trade tariffs driving up inflation. Chris Weston from Pepperstone stated in a report, &quot;All eyes will be focused on the degree to which core goods inflation is being affected by tariffs and whether these factors will be more prominent in the August CPI.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>HTX DeepThink: Federal Reserve Board Governor Nomination Triggers Policy Game Theory, Multiple Key Data Tests Cryptocurrency Market</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24007</link>
      <description>On August 11th, the HTX Researcher Chloe pointed out that Trump nominated his long-term economic advisor, Stephen Moore, to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board. This strengthened the market&apos;s expectations for the Fed&apos;s future loose monetary policy. Moore advocates for rate cuts, which is in contrast to Powell&apos;s cautious stance and has driven the recent rebound of risk assets such as Bitcoin.This week, the market is focusing on three key data points: July CPI, PPI, and retail sales. If the inflation data is higher than expected, investors may reduce their rate cut bets, leading to a stronger dollar and pressure on the crypto market. If retail sales are weak, it will support the expectation of a rate cut in September and be favorable for the continued rise of risk assets.In addition, in terms of geopolitics, Trump and Putin will meet in Alaska on August 15th to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, which may affect market risk appetite.Overall, this week the crypto ma</description>
