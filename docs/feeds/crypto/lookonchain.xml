      <title>Polymarket Updates Oracle Mechanism, Introduces Proposal Whitelisting to Improve Market Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24152</link>
      <description>On August 12th, as per official documentation, Polymarket has made an announcement regarding the update of its oracle mechanism. A new MOOV2 contract has been introduced to replace the previous OOV2 contract. This is done to address issues such as premature proposals, the lack of experience leading to frequent disputes, and market delays. The most controversial change in the MOOV2 contract is the establishment of a proposal whitelist.Under the old OOV2 contract, any user was able to submit a proposal. This led to many first-time proposers losing their deposits due to lack of experience, resulting in market settlement delays of up to four days and negatively impacting user experience.The new MOOV2 contract stipulates that only whitelisted addresses can submit proposals.

This move encourages thorough pre-proposal discussions, thereby reducing disputes and delay</description>
