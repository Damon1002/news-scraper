      <title>Santiment: Ethereum Retail Traders Continue to Sell Off During ETH Price Surge</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24351</link>
      <description>On August 13th, the cryptocurrency market analysis firm Santiment declared that &quot;Ethereum is currently merely 6.4% away from its historical high of $4,891 on November 16, 2021. During Ethereum&apos;s upward movement, retail traders have been constantly offloading. &quot;In history, price trends often go against the expectations of retail traders. On June 16, 2025, and July 30, extreme greed sentiment emerged, resulting in price corrections. Nevertheless, as the asset price continuously reaches new highs, traders have exhibited panic (FUD) and doubts.Currently, major stakeholders are accumulating Ethereum chips that retail traders are willing to sell, and the price shows almost no resistance from market sentiment, suggesting that Ethereum is likely to break through soon and set a new all-time high.</description>

      <title>Nomura: The Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in September, with a total of 75 basis points expected over three cuts.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24347</link>
      <description>August 13th. Nomura&apos;s economist currently holds the view that due to a weak labor market and a reduction in inflation risks, the Fed will commence cutting interest rates in September. In a report, Nomura&apos;s economists stated that the Fed might reduce interest rates by 25 basis points during the September meeting, followed by another cut in December and the subsequent March. Although the median expectation of analysts is a 25-basis-point cut in the next three months, economists hold different views on the timing of the rate cuts. Nomura was previously among those institutions that anticipated that Fed officials would wait until later this year to loosen policy. (IG)</description>

      <title>Cathie Wood: Expects Bitcoin Price to Exceed $1 Million Within 5 Years</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24346</link>
      <description>On August 13th, Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest, stated in an interview with CoinDesk: &quot;ARK&apos;s bullish forecast for Bitcoin still firmly anticipates it to exceed $1 million within five years. I believe that the more prominent driving force currently is its transformation into the entry point for institutions into digital assets and its role as a substitute for gold as a store of value, and our stance on this has remained unchanged entirely.&quot;ARK had predicted that Ethereum would evolve into an institutional protocol, and this prediction is now coming to fruition: Both Coinbase and Robinhood&apos;s L2 solutions are built upon Ethereum; the growth of stablecoins is primarily centered around the Ethereum network; in contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum&apos;s treasury companies offer utility and staking functions; despite Ethereum having higher transaction costs and slower speeds, it provides a higher level of decentralization and security.
