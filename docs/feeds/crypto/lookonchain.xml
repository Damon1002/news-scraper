      <title>Analyst: The Fed May Restart Rate Cuts in September</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22128</link>
      <description>On July 28th. Analysts from Bank Pictet stated in a report that the Federal Reserve might resume its rate-cutting cycle during the September FOMC meeting. They pointed out that the weakening economic prospects suggest that the Fed will adopt looser monetary policy in the second half of the year. They further added that the uncertainty regarding inflation following the tariff increase, along with the political pressure from President Trump to cut rates, have prevented a rate cut this month.They declared that after July, the stagnant private consumption and the reduced investment plans (indicating softening demand) will demonstrate that despite inflation being above the target, it is justified to ease the restrictive policy stance.
