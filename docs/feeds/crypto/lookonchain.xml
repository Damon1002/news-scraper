      <title>Gold Price Hits Another All-Time High, Safe-Haven Demand and Rate Cut Expectations Fuel Rally</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27416</link>
      <description>September 3rd. The price of gold reached a record high because of the escalating demand for safe havens, strengthened expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut, and continuous central bank gold purchases. Krishan Gopaul, the Market Intelligence Manager at the World Gold Council, pointed out that the ongoing market uncertainties, concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve, reignited expectations of a September rate cut, the resurfacing of U.S. stagflation risks, and the general weakness of the U.S. dollar have jointly enhanced the attractiveness of gold. Geopolitical tensions and tariff concerns have further consolidated this trend. Gold ETFs, gold bars, and gold coins continue to receive strong investor demand, while central banks around the world are continuously promoting reserve diversification, ensuring that the core factors driving this rally will not fade away in the short term.

      <title>Nvidia Denies H100/H200 Chip Shortage Rumors: Ample Inventory to Instantly Meet Order Demand</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27413</link>
      <description>September 3rd, Nvidia (NVDA.O) declared that the recent media reports regarding the &quot;limited supply&quot; and &quot;sold out&quot; rumors about Nvidia&apos;s H100/H200 chips are all inaccurate. As detailed in the financial report, while cloud service partners are indeed capable of leasing all of their H100/H200 chips online, this does not imply that Nvidia is unable to accept new orders. With an ample stock of H100/H200, they can promptly fulfill all order requirements. Rumors suggesting that the H20 chip is cutting into the supply of H100/H200 or Blackwell products are also entirely unfoundedâ€”sales of the H20 chip will never have an impact on Nvidia&apos;s supply capabilities for other products.
