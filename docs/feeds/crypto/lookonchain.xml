      <title>Strike Founder: Bitcoin is Disrupting the Currency Market, Ethereum is at Best a Tech Startup</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27803</link>
      <description>On September 5th, the founder of Strike, Jack Mallers, responded to Joseph Lubin, the co-founder of Ethereum, who previously stated that Ethereum would surpass Bitcoin. He said, &quot;I think this view is ridiculous. Bitcoin is disrupting the currency market, and that is Bitcoin&apos;s goal. It is a $500 trillion question of value. Ethereum is a technology. At best, it is also an emerging tech company. The two cannot be compared.&quot;</description>
