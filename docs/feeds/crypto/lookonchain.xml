      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $115,000, the mainstream CEX liquidation pressure will reach $1.59 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22350</link>
      <description>On July 30th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin drops beneath $115,000, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX will amount to $1.59 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin surges above $119,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX will reach $390 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not disclose the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows the extent to which the asset price reaching a certain level will be impacted. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, a more intense reaction will occur due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>
