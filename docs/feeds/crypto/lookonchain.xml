      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27306</link>

      <title>CryptoQuant Analyst: BTC Has Retraced Around 12% from Its New High, Which Is Completely Normal and Has Not Yet Exceeded the Historical Average Correction of 20% to 25%</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27301</link>

      <description>On September 2nd, ZachXBT disclosed the charging standards and wallet addresses of more than 200 crypto KOLs on the X platform yesterday. ZachXBT stated that among the more than 160 paid promoters, fewer than 5 clearly marked their posts as advertisements.ZachXBT believes that in many jurisdictions, failing to disclose the promotional nature of information may even be illegal. &quot;I have said many times that if you disclose paid promotion information for a project that you truly believe in, then paid promotion is acceptable. If you think that influential people should be allowed to secretly accept money to promote projects and mislead fans, then this indicates many problems.&quot;</description>
