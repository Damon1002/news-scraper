      <title>Arthur Hayes: Bitcoin Expected to Test $100,000, Ethereum to Test $3,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22897</link>
      <description>On August 2nd, Arthur Hayes gave a response regarding the recent profit-taking activities on social media. He stated, &quot;The U.S. tariff relief program is set to expire in the third quarter... at least, this is how the market perceives it following the release of the non-farm payroll data. Currently, major economies have not been able to generate credit at a sufficient pace to boost nominal GDP. Therefore, Bitcoin will undergo a test at $100,000, and Ethereum will be tested at $3,000. For more details, please attend my keynote speech at WebX Asia in Tokyo on August 25th. I am now going to take some time to relax.&quot;It was previously reported by BlockBeats that Arthur Hayes sold 2,373 ETH ($8.32 million), 7.76 million ENA ($4.62 million), and 38.86 billion PEPE ($41,470) earlier today.</description>

After the revision, the combined May and June non-farm employment numbers were 258,000 lower than previously reported.U.S. President Trump directly pointed out in a tweet that &quot;this is a scam against him&quot;: &quot;In my view, today&apos;s job data has been manipulated to humiliate Republicans and me—just as before and after the 2024 presidential election. First, they presented three days of excellent data, and then on November 15, 2024, shortly after the election, this data was significantly revised downward—a complete scam.&quot; Trump then ordered the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, and his deputy William Wiatrowski served</description>
