      <title>Matrixport: Retail Leveraging Surges Ahead of FOMC, Key Catalyst Could Play Out After Summer</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21486</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, Matrixport released today&apos;s market analysis which stated, &quot;In the past two weeks, the open interest of Bitcoin futures contracts has witnessed a significant increase of $6 billion. The annualized funding rate has soared to 19%, suggesting the existence of a large number of aggressive leveraged long positions in the market. Simultaneously, the activity of South Korean retail traders has increased significantly. Cryptocurrency trading volume has jumped from $10 billion to $60 billion, reflecting the dominant role of retail funds in this round of the market.&quot;However, as the price enters a consolidation phase, these high-leverage long positions may be exposed to forced liquidation risks. Especially after next week&apos;s FOMC meeting, as the market enters a relatively quiet August trading period.Despite short-term volatility, multiple key positives are accumulating for a post-summer surge, and the overall upward trend in the crypto market still remains intact.&quot;</description>

      <title>PIMCO: Trump May Reshape Fed Outlook Through Personnel Appointments</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21483</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, Tiffany Wilding, an economist at Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), pointed out in a report that although U.S. President Trump may continue to criticize the Federal Reserve in the short term and call for rate cuts, he will not replace the current Chairman Powell. Instead, Trump will influence Fed decisions through upcoming appointments. For example, the term of Governor Quarles will expire in January and the Chairmanship of Powell will expire in May. It is worth noting that Powell&apos;s term as governor will continue until January 2028. Wilding emphasized that regardless of who Trump nominates to succeed as chairman, the new leader must put forward a convincing monetary policy stance. Firstly, they need to obtain Senate approval and then seek majority support from the Federal Open Market Committee. (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>If Ethereum falls below $3600, the cumulative long liquidation on major CEXs will reach $1.79 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21482</link>
      <description>On July 23rd, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum drops below $3600, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs in terms of long positions will reach $1.79 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum surges above $3800, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs in terms of short positions will reach $1.186 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that once the price reaches that level, it will generate a stronger reaction due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>
