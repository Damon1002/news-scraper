      <title>Opinion: Allocating only 2% of a 401(k) to Bitcoin and Ethereum would surpass 1.5 times the total ETF inflows to date</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23719</link>
      <description>August 8th. Concerning Trump&apos;s signing of an executive order enabling 401(k) retirement funds to invest in cryptocurrency, Jake Ostrovskis, an OTC trader at Wintermute, stated that the impact of this action should not be underestimated. &quot;Simply a 2% allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum is equivalent to 1.5 times the cumulative inflows of ETFs up to now. Meanwhile, a 3% allocation would more than double the overall market&apos;s inflow. The crucial point is that these buyers are largely insensitive to prices and focus on meeting their allocation targets rather than engaging in tactical trading.&quot; (CoinDesk)</description>
