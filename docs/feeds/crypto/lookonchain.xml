      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the mainstream CEX&apos;s total long liquidation amount will reach $984 million</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25025</link>
      <description>On August 18th, according to Coinglass data, in the event that Bitcoin drops below $113,000, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will amount to $984 million.On the other hand, if Bitcoin rises above $117,000, the cumulative liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach $688 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not precisely depict the number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Consequently, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it attains a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that once the price reaches that level, it will undergo a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>Matrixport: Bitcoin to Revisit $112,000 or Lower, Market Awaits Fed FOMC Meeting as Key Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25020</link>
      <description>On August 18th, Matrixport issued a new report indicating that Bitcoin was unable to hold the downtrend line. This initially signaled a breakout but recently dropped below the former support. Although not overly worried about further downside risks, due to the market remaining cautious ahead of the September Fed rate decision, the Bitcoin price may once again test the $112,000 level.Matrixport does not anticipate that this year&apos;s Jackson Hole meeting will release any significant signals as it is more of a discussion platform rather than a market driver. Currently, the market is awaiting a real catalyst, with the September 17th FOMC meeting being the most crucial event.Technically, Bitcoin is currently in a &quot;no man&apos;s land&quot; between $112,000 and $117,292. This leaves traders with two distinct strategies: buying on a breakout above the range or accumulating on a pullback near $112,000. In other words, the market is in a period of observation, waiting for a clear direction.</description>
