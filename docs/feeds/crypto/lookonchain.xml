      <title>Federal Reserve&apos;s Kashkari: Two rate cuts this year still seems appropriate</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23429</link>
      <description>August 6: Fed&apos;s Kashkari stated that the economy is decelerating and the Fed needs to respond to this economic slowdown. It may still be appropriate to adjust the policy rate in the short term. The answer regarding the inflation issue may take some time to become known, while the data on the economic slowdown is clear. Two rate cuts this year still seem to be appropriate. However, if inflation rises due to tariffs, the Fed may pause rate cuts or even raise rates. Adjusting the rate policy may be better than waiting. Unemployment rate data is of great importance, but the Fed is aware that this data may be revised. (FX168)</description>
