      <title>Eric Conner: The future price increase of ETH is expected to come from the global adoption of stablecoins, rather than corporate treasuries embracing it</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21721</link>
      <description>On July 24th, Eric Conner, a former Ethereum core developer, stated that &quot;in the next few years, the future price growth of Ethereum (ETH) actually does not depend on the adoption of &apos;treasury companies&apos;. The real bull market logic lies in the global adoption of stablecoins. People all over the world are eager to obtain USD exposure, and this demand will experience explosive growth. In this process, tens of billions of people may come into contact with and get to know Ethereum.&quot;</description>

      <title>Glassnode: On-chain data shows that BTC has formed a low-density buy zone in the $110,000 to $117,000 range, potentially serving as a strong support area.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21716</link>
      <description>On July 24th, Glassnode put out a post saying, &quot;The rapid ascent of BTC from $110,000 to $117,000 created an &apos;air pocket&apos; or a low-density accumulation zone on the blockchain. Since Bitcoin surged to a historical high of $122,600, the price has stayed above this range. If this support is broken through, history shows that such gaps may still develop into a bottom-building zone.&quot;</description>

      <description>On July 24th, Trump posted on Truth Social and said, &quot;Everyone is suggesting that I will annul Musk&apos;s substantial subsidies from the U.S. government, thereby ruining his company.

The better they perform, the better America performs, and this is beneficial to all of us. We are setting records every day, and I hope this trend will continue.&quot;</description>
