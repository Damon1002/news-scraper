      <title>Opinion: ETH Transaction Share Reaches This Cycle&apos;s Peak, ETH/BTC Exchange Rate Still Undervalued</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26000</link>
      <description>August 24th. In a post, on-chain data analyst Murphy stated that the transaction platform traffic share of ETH is calculated by taking the ratio of the USD value of ETH and BTC flowing in and out of all trading platforms, which represents the percentage of ETH. This is also a key indicator for measuring which of the two mainstream crypto assets, ETH or BTC, is receiving more attention or support from funds. On August 15th, ETH&apos;s traffic share reached as high as 48% (as indicated by the red curve in the chart), marking the highest point in this cycle so far. This ratio means that nearly half of the funds flowing in and out of the trading platforms are in ETH, almost on an equal footing with BTC, indirectly confirming the current market&apos;s high interest in ETH.If we compare nearly 10 years of this data with the ETH/BTC exchange rate curve (as shown by the blue curve in the chart), we can observe that the red and blue lines are highly synchronized. The logic is: when more funds begin to</description>

      <title>Analysis: Interest Rate Cut Will Exacerbate Historic Wealth Disparity, Asset Holders Will Outrun Inflation</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25999</link>
      <description>On August 24th, The Kobeissi Letter issued its most recent market analysis, indicating that the anticipated rate cut will not be as forceful as what Trump anticipates, amounting to 300 basis points. The last time the Fed cut rates due to surging inflation was in the 1970s, leading to a continuous and historical widening of the wealth gap. In 1990, the wealth gap between the richest 1% and the poorest 50% of the population was $3 trillion, and now it is $40 trillion. Currently, the wealthiest 0.1% of the US population holds wealth that is 5.5 times that of the poorest 50%.In fact, the Fed has truly &quot;fallen behind&quot; in the current global rate-cutting cycle. Central banks around the world cut rates a total of 15 times in May alone, which is the fastest monthly rate-cut pace so far this year and one of the largest rate-cutting waves of this century, firmly setting the stage for the Fed&apos;s first rate cut to occur just one month later in 2025. Additionally, Fed Chairman Powell has 8 months r</description>

      <description>On August 24th, the Ethereum-based game L3 Xai initiated a lawsuit against Musk&apos;s AI company xAI, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition.
