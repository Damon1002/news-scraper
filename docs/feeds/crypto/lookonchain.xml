      <title>James Wynn admits to overleveraging, succumbing to the spotlight effect, leading to a meltdown in the end.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23900</link>
      <description>August 10th, James Wynn put out a post and summed it up like this: &quot;In this world, there is no such thing as a mistake. There are only lessons. Whenever I encounter what others might call a mistake or a failure in my life, I always manage to learn from it. The most significant lesson recently was when I turned 3 million dollars into 100 million dollars but then lost it all in front of everyone.&quot;&quot;That time was extremely intense - with adrenaline pumping, chaos all around, and a complete madness. I faced it with a smile and a laugh. This is another lesson - I got overly leveraged and was blinded by all the &apos;attention,&apos; losing complete control of my emotions. I don&apos;t want to change anything that has happened. Even if you were to send me back to that moment and give me the choice to cash out, I wouldn&apos;t. I value this lesson more. Money is boundless; it is everywhere and easy to make.&quot;&quot;When I reached 100 million dollars, you cheered for me. And when I fell to the bottom, you laughed at</description>

In other words, these two rather ordinary &apos;minds&apos; managed to defeat all the super geniuses on Wall Street, which amounts to thousands of people. This is all insider information! Is anyone looking into this??? She is an extremely nauseating disgrace, having impeached me twice without any valid reason and failed! Nancy, how do you feel now???&quot;</description>

      <title>S&amp;P Global: July U.S. CPI Data to Be Key Economic Indicator for New Week</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23895</link>
      <description>On August 10th, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s Global indicated that the July U.S. CPI data would be a key economic indicator in the new week. Due to tariff policies causing inflation expectations to rise, the market is eagerly anticipating this report. Despite the current tariff developments (such as the higher tariffs imposed on August 7th and the latest threat of 100% chip tariffs), which suggest a possible increase in inflation, the overall U.S. second-quarter consumer price increase has remained below 3.0%.It is worthy of note that the Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s Global U.S. PMI data, as a leading indicator of CPI trends, has hinted that inflation may pick up in the second half of 2025. Therefore, the upcoming CPI data will confirm whether prices in July have begun to accelerate. This is crucial for the Fed&apos;s monetary policy as there is potential price volatility, and the Fed is currently maintaining a wait-and-see stance. (FXStreet)</description>
