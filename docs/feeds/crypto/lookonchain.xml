      <title>This week, the combined trading volume of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs reached an all-time high, driven by a surge in Ethereum ETF trading volume.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24840</link>
      <description>On August 16th, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this week, the trading volume of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs was approximately $40 billion, reaching a historical peak. This was attributed to the significant surge in the Ethereum ETF. The massive trading volume is equivalent to the total of the top five ETFs or the top ten stocks.In particular, the weekly trading volume of the Ethereum ETF was around $17 billion, which also hit a historical high. &quot;It seems as if it had been dormant for 11 months and then compressed a year&apos;s worth of trading into 6 weeks.&quot;</description>

      <title>Fed&apos;s Daly: Cutting Interest Rates Twice This Year Is Appropriate</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24838</link>
      <description>August 16th. In an economic report where retail sales last month were stronger than expected and wholesale prices witnessed an unexpected surge, 2027 FOMC voter and the San Francisco Fed President, Daly, hinted during an interview that she remains prepared to commence policy easing as early as next month.Daly stated that the labor market is showing signs of softening, the economy is decelerating but not coming to a complete standstill. Given that inflation is still above the Fed&apos;s target, &quot;there would be grounds to cut rates a couple of times this year. We will wait for more data. It might be that we cut less or perhaps cut more, but ultimately, I think that two rate cuts this year still remains a reasonable forecast. What I don&apos;t want to do is become overly concerned that inflation could start to rise again or persist to a point where we are not providing support to the labor market while we await clarity on this matter.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
