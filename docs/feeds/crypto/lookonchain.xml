      <title>AI Chess Championship: OpenAI o3 Dominates to Win, Musk&apos;s Grok Shut Out in the Final</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24515</link>
      <description>On August 14th, last week, OpenAI&apos;s o3 model triumphed over xAI&apos;s Grok 4 in an artificial intelligence (AI) chess competition and emerged as the champion. The &quot;AI Chess Exhibition Match,&quot; which was held on Google&apos;s subsidiary Kaggle platform, saw eight AI models engage in a three-day elimination tournament to determine the champion, runner-up, and third-place finishers.In this competition, the AI models were required to play chess without any specific training and were only allowed to gather some chess knowledge from the internet prior to the match. In the final, OpenAI&apos;s o3 defeated Grok 4 with a score of 4-0, claiming the championship. It is notable that o3 won all three matches with a perfect 4-0 score and also swept its sibling o4 mini in the semi-finals.Earlier this year, in another tournament hosted by chess master Levy Rozman, both Grok and ChatGPT lost to the AI system Stockfish, which is specifically designed for chess.</description>
