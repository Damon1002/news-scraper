      <title>CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Profit Taken Reached a Bottom Lower Than Before, Accumulation Trend Dominates Market</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24732</link>
      <description>On August 15th, the CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. posted a message indicating that the cumulative distribution of long-term holders who have held Bitcoin for six months to two years shows that the supply they hold has increased from 3.551 million BTC in April (when the Bitcoin price was $83,000) to the current 5.191 million BTC, with a growth of 1.64 million BTC. During the test at the all-time high (ATH) of $118,000, there was a moderate profit-taking, and the 7-day average outflow of long-term holders rose to 20,000 BTC, which is significantly lower than the past typical outflow peaks (40,000 to 70,000 BTC). Overall, this suggests that in the current market, the Bitcoin accumulation trend is more dominant compared to profit distribution.</description>

      <title>Matrixport: The Fed has lagged behind market expectations in its interest rate cuts for 32 consecutive months. It is expected to cut rates by a total of approximately 62 basis points over the next ...</title>

      <description>August 15th. Matrixport disclosed its latest research report indicating that the U.S. market is entering a brand-new liquidity release cycle. Structural funding support may potentially lead to continuous upside for Bitcoin and risk assets. The market is expected to maintain this trend until 2026. The current fund structure, credit environment, and policy shift towards dovishness closely resemble the early stages of past bull markets. Abundant liquidity, an improved credit environment, and dovish policy shifts - all these multiple bullish factors are resonating to drive up asset prices.In the U.S., the money market fund has witnessed rapid expansion since the fourth quarter of 2018. It has grown from $3 trillion to $7.4 trillion, reaching a historical high. Currently, the annual interest income reaches $320 billion, constituting significant incremental funds flowing into high-yield assets.

      <title>Yi Lihua: The future decade of the crypto industry is still the greatest opportunity for the average person. Long-term bullishness is the key to growth and success.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24728</link>
      <description>On August 15th, the founder of Liquid Capital (formerly LD Capital), Li Huayi, posted on the X Platform, stating: &quot;In the past decade, the crypto industry has been the greatest opportunity for ordinary people, and it will continue to be so in the next decade. Do not let short-term thinking mislead the long-term trend. I come from a rural area, and both of my parents are illiterate. After earning my first bucket of gold through entrepreneurship, I invested in tech companies while going all-in on the crypto industry. Looking back at 2015, none of these decisions seemed reliable at that time, but now it has been proved that they were all correct (although a substantial tuition fee was paid during the investment/trading/management process). Only by having a long-term bullish view can one achieve exponential growth and harvest.&quot;</description>
