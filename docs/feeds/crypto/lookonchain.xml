      <title>Analyst: Fed Meeting Minutes &quot;Outdated,&quot; Focus on Powell&apos;s Friday Jackson Hole Speech</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25529</link>
      <description>August 21st. The minutes from the Fed&apos;s July meeting indicated that policymakers&apos; worries about high inflation surpassed their concerns regarding a slowdown in the labor market, resulting in a slight rise in the US dollar. It was noted in the minutes that &quot;the majority of participants assessed that the risks to inflation were skewed towards the upside in comparison to the risks to a decelerating labor market.&quot; This meeting took place prior to the release of the July US nonfarm payroll data, which showed job figures for July that were weaker than anticipated.A Danske Bank analyst stated in a report that this implies that the Fed minutes were &quot;somewhat out of date,&quot; and the market reaction was relatively limited. Currently, the market&apos;s focus has shifted to Fed Chair Powell&apos;s speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Symposium. (FXStreet)</description>
