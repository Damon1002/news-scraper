      <title>Goldman Sachs: Expects the Fed to Hold Rates Next Week, Will Cut Later on Slowing Job Market</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21386</link>
      <description>July 22nd. According to Goldman Sachs, the Federal Reserve is predicted to maintain the interest rate unchanged next week and start cutting rates in the remaining three meetings of 2025. This is because the slowing job market is putting pressure on policymakers. The current private sector hiring has almost reached a &quot;standstill pace,&quot; and there is a risk of further aggravating the slowdown. Meanwhile, consumer spending has been stagnant for six consecutive months, which is an extremely rare situation outside of an economic recession. Goldman Sachs also anticipates that the Fed will cut rates twice again in early 2026.</description>
