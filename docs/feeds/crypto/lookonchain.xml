      <description>On August 27th, as per CNBC, sources disclosed that a Federal Reserve Board member, Lisa Cook, is scheduled to file a lawsuit as early as today (in connection with Trump&apos;s dismissal).BlockBeats reported yesterday that U.S. President Trump signed a document removing the Federal Reserve Board member Cook from office with immediate effect. In the document, Trump stated: &quot;By the authority vested in me by Article II of the U.S. Constitution and the amended 1913 Federal Reserve Act, I hereby dismiss Cook from the Board of the Federal Reserve System. Given Cook&apos;s lack of honesty in financial matters and potential engagement in criminal activities, I cannot have confidence in your integrity. At the very least, these actions demonstrate serious negligence in your financial transactions, raising doubts about your ability and credibility as a financial regulator.&quot;</description>
