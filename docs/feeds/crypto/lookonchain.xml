      <title>Standard Chartered: Ethereum Treasury Company Now &apos;Very Investible,&apos; Superior to U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23468</link>
      <description>On August 7th, as reported by The Block, Geoffrey Kendrick, the Global Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, stated that Ethereum Treasury Companies are currently &quot;very worthy of investment&quot; and are more attractive to investors compared to a U.S. spot Ethereum ETF. The Net Asset Value (NAV) multiple of Ethereum Treasury Companies, which is the market cap divided by the held ETH value, is currently &quot;starting to normalize&quot; and is expected to remain above 1, making it a better investment target than a U.S. spot ETH ETF. Kendrick said: &quot;I see no reason why the NAV multiple should be below 1.0, as I believe these companies present investors with a regulatory arbitrage opportunity.&quot; With the normalization of the NAV multiple, Ethereum Treasury Companies can provide better opportunities for Ethereum price appreciation, staking rewards, and per-ETH growth compared to a U.S. spot ETH ETF, which currently cannot participate in staking or decentralized finance (DeFi).Kendr</description>

      <title>Federal Reserve&apos;s Powell: Labor Market Slowing, Tariffs Only Have Short-Term Impact, Fed Will Soon Cut Interest Rates</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23465</link>
      <description>July 8th. The President of the San Francisco Fed, Daly, stated on Wednesday that given the moderating labor market and her assessment that tariffs pose only a short-term threat to inflation, she is of the view that the Fed will soon be required to cut interest rates. &quot;In the absence of tariffs, inflation has been gradually declining. Along with the economy slowing down and monetary policy remaining restrictive, inflation is expected to continue to fall.&quot; She further added that although tariffs have pushed up inflation in the short term, it is unlikely to have a lasting influence. Meanwhile, the labor market has exhibited signs of weakness. &quot;I believe that further slowing would be a cause for concern. Once the labor market begins to waver, it typically deteriorates rapidly and severely. All of this indicates that we are likely to need to adjust policy in the coming months.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>Trump Says He Will Nominate an Acting Fed Board Member in the Coming Days</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23467</link>
      <description>On August 7th, President Trump stated that he might nominate an interim member of the Federal Reserve Board in the following days to fill a vacancy instead of taking the chance to promote his preferred candidate for the next Fed chair. &quot;We may make the interim appointment first, and then we&apos;ll make the permanent appointment,&quot; Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. &quot;I think the interim will be announced within the next two to three days, and then we will make the permanent appointment.&quot;Trump said he is considering &quot;probably&quot; three candidates for this position, and they may come from Wall Street. He further added that Commerce Secretary Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and Vice President Pence are each advisors in this process. Trump reiterated that he still regards former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as leading candidates for the chairmanship in case of a vacancy.

      <title>Vitalik: Ethereum will eventually achieve instant cross-L2 native asset transfers via L1</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23462</link>
      <description>On August 7th, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, stated in a post that he was very pleased to witness many mainstream Layer 2 solutions entering Stage 1, which is the &quot;limited training rounds&quot;. The next objective is to achieve fast withdrawals through a zero-knowledge proof system. He considers this to be more significant than reaching Stage 2, which is &quot;without training rounds&quot;. Fast withdrawal times are of great importance as they will lower the capital costs for liquidity providers. If the native withdrawal time can be shortened to less than 1 hour in the short term and to 12 seconds in the medium term, Ethereum Layer 1 will further enhance its position as the default platform for issuing assets and as the economic center of the Ethereum ecosystem.For this to be achieved, we need to give up the Optimistic proof system, which essentially requires waiting for several days to make a withdrawal. Historically, zero-knowledge proof technology was immature and costly, making the</description>

      <title>Tornado Cash Case Reaches Partial Settlement: Guilty of Operating Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23461</link>
      <description>On August 7th, during the trial of Roman Storm, the co-founder of Tornado Cash, a partial verdict was reached. The charge of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business was sustained. The charge of money laundering conspiracy remains undetermined. And the third charge (evading sanctions) resulted in an acquittal.Roman Storm stood trial in the federal court of the Southern District of New York. This case could potentially set a legal precedent regarding the extent of responsibility that developers should bear when the decentralized software they created is used illegally. The U.S. prosecutors accused Storm of conspiracy in money laundering, violating U.S. sanction regulations, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. If found guilty, he could face a maximum prison term of 40 years.</description>
