      <title>Tom Lee: Once interest rates reflect the Fed&apos;s dovish stance, the market will end the year strong in 2025</title>

He stated, &quot;As we enter the final third of 2025, the most significant change is the Fed&apos;s transformation towards dovishness. The ISM index is expected to rebound above 50, laying the groundwork for a strong year-end in the market of 2025. The S&amp;P 500 index has already increased by 9% year-to-date, which is an astonishing performance in any year. Looking ahead to the last few months of 2025, it is anticipated that the market will generally continue to maintain a strong momentum.&quot;&quot;In fact, 2025 can be divided into three phases: the first phase is tariff concerns from January to April; the second phase is a V-shaped rebound from April until now; and the third phase is a dovish Fed combined with the recovery of the ISM. Tom Lee believes that the S&amp;P 500 index will reach 6800-7000 points by the end of the year. However, this will not be a linear path. Once interest rat</description>

      <title>Analyst: Powell to Uphold Cautious Stance, Potentially Supporting US Dollar in the Short Term</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25383</link>
      <description>August 20th. Jane Foley, the foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank, stated in a report that if Federal Reserve Chairman Powell shows caution regarding a rate cut in his forthcoming speech, speculators may unwind their previously held short positions on the US dollar in the short term. Both the market and Rabobank anticipate that the Fed will cut rates in September, which indicates a weakening labor market. However, Foley pointed out that Powell may still be cautious about easing policy when delivering a speech at the Jackson Hole central bank symposium this Friday. This attitude could offer support to the dollar in the short run. Nevertheless, Rabobank still expects the Euro to US Dollar (EUR/USD) to reach 1.20 in the spring of next year as the market anticipates more rate cuts. (FXStreet)</description>
