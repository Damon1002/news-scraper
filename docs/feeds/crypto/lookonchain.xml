      <title>「Trump Fires Fed Board Member Powell Case」 to be Defended by Washington Legal Legend Abbe Lowell on behalf of Powell</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27474</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, the &quot;Case of Trump Firing Fed Chair Powell&quot; will be defended by Abbe Lowell, a legendary lawyer in Washington, on behalf of Powell.It is reported that Lowell&apos;s past clients have included New York Attorney General Letitia James, Hunter Biden, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and many other high-profile political figures, regardless of their party affiliations (whether they are Republicans or Democrats).For Lowell, facing a presidential administration&apos;s attempt to control the actions of a federal regulatory agency is not a new situation. He has been deeply involved in the Washington legal community for decades. Lowell stated in an MSNBC interview last month, &quot;I have basically challenged the overreach of every government agency in every administration since Ronald Reagan. Whether it is a Democratic or Republican government, if the government overreaches, it is the duty of a lawyer to bring it back on track.&quot; (Golden Finance)</description>

      <title>Bridgewater Fund Founder: Dollar&apos;s Poor Debt Situation Indirectly Drives Cryptocurrency and Gold Price Surge</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27469</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, stated today that he does not think that the easing of cryptocurrency regulation will pose a threat to the status of the US dollar as a reserve currency. Nevertheless, the deteriorating debt situation of the US dollar and other reserve currency-issuing governments affects their attractiveness as reserve currencies and stores of value. This has always been one of the factors driving the rise in the prices of gold and cryptocurrencies.Moreover, Ray Dalio does not believe that the exposure of stablecoins to government bonds presents a systemic risk. The real risk lies in the declining purchasing power of government bonds. If stablecoins are well-regulated, this should not pose any systemic risk.&quot;Cryptocurrency is currently an alternative currency with a limited supply.
