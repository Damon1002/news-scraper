      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27972</link>
      <description>On September 6th, the WLFI token of RMRK founder Bruno Skvorc was frozen by the WLFI team. The WLFI team responded that &quot;the addressed in question is suspected of engaging in high-risk blockchain activities and cannot be unfrozen.&quot;Bruno Skvorc stated, &quot;They stole my money. Since this incident involves the Trump family, I can do nothing about it. This is the new era of the Mafia. There is nowhere to appeal, no one to reason with, and no one to sue.

Investors hold the same view, which has boosted the probability of a rate cut at this month&apos;s meeting to 99%.Monday, 23:00: The 1-year inflation expectation of the U.S. New York Fed for August;Tuesday, 22:00: The nonfarm employment benchmark revision for 2025 in the U.S.;Wednesday, 20:30: U.S. August PPI data;Wednesday, 22:00: U.S. July Wholesale Sales month-on-month;Thursday, 20:30: U.S. August CPI data and U.S. Initial Jobless Claims up to September 6th;Friday, 22:00: The init</description>

      <title>BiyaPay Analyst: US August Non-Farm Payrolls Data Disappointing, Bitcoin Weekly Chart Shows Weakness, Possible Support at $93,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27966</link>
      <description>September 6th: On the evening of September 5th, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics made an announcement. Only 22,000 non-farm jobs were added in August, which is much lower than the market&apos;s expectation of 75,000. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, reaching a new high since the end of 2021.This weak employment data has led to a decline in the U.S. dollar and a rise in gold prices, causing volatility in the short-term trend of Bitcoin. Looking at the latest Bitcoin candlestick chart, the weekly chart of BTC is showing a clear downward trend. It has been closing below key support levels for several consecutive weeks. The short-term moving averages are trending downward, and there is a clear bearish crossover in the MACD, indicating a weakening of the bullish momentum. From a technical perspective, if Bitcoin fails to hold above the $100,000 psychological level, the immediate support below may first test the range of $96,000 to $98,000. Further breakdown could extend to around $93,000</description>
