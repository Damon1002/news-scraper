      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25091</link>
      <description>On August 19th, US Treasury Secretary Yellen declared that &quot;Enacting the GENIUS Act is of great significance in guaranteeing the United States&apos; dominance in the digital asset domain. Stablecoins will expand the global utilization channels of the US dollar by billions of dollars and result in a notable increase in the demand for US Treasury bonds.&quot;Since the GENIUS Act was passed in July, the supply of yield-bearing stablecoins has witnessed a significant increase. The data indicates that the main beneficiaries are Ethena&apos;s USDe and Sky&apos;s USDS. Both earn yields when staked in their respective protocols. According to DefiLlama data, since July 18th, the circulating supply of USDe has grown by 70%, exceeding $10 billion and ranking it third among all stablecoins in terms of market capitalization. During the same period, the circulating supply of USDS rose by 23% to nearly $4.81 billion, placing it fourth in terms of market capitalization.</description>
