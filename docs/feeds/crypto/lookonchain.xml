      <title>BiyaPay Analyst: BTC Monthly Drop Mainly due to ETF Outflows</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26492</link>
      <description>On August 27th, the analysis by BiyaPay pointed out that the price decline of BTC this month is associated with the outflows of ETF funds. In order to welcome a potential bull market by the end of the year, a large amount of fund inflow is required.In January 2024, 11 physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs were listed on NASDAQ, enabling investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without having to self-custody the coins. Since then, these funds have cumulatively attracted $53.9 billion in investment.However, these funds recorded a net outflow of $972 million this month, which is the second largest since their inception, second only to February&apos;s $3.56 billion. If the data on Friday still shows a net outflow, it will mark the end of a four-month trend of fund inflows.</description>

      <title>QCP Capital: Market closely watching tonight&apos;s NVIDIA earnings report, a drop in US stocks will increase crypto market risk</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26491</link>
      <description>On August 27th, QCP Capital announced on its official channel that President Trump appears to be determined to form a more closely-knit team within the Fed in order to tilt policy towards dovishness. Currently, Bowman, Waller, and Mester are widely regarded as Trump supporters. If Governor Quarles is replaced, even without appointing to the two vice chair positions and the next chair, the pro-Trump voice on the board will increase to four seats.Last week&apos;s Jackson Hole meeting redefined the Fed&apos;s risk balance. Officials expressed greater concerns about a slowdown in the labor market and noted the downward revision of nonfarm data. In our opinion, the labor market background is now more prominent than the risk of inflation accelerating. This has laid the foundation for a rate cut in Septemberâ€”although nonfarm and CPI data will be released before the FOMC meeting.Furthermore, in the AI field, NVIDIA, a benchmark, will report earnings after the market closes today. The market will clo</description>
