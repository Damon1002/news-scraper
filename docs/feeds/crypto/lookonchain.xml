      <title>Bitunix Analyst: WLFI Experiences Massive Volume on First Day of Trading, Followed by Retracement; High Risk of Politicized Token Issuance; Heatmap Indicates Support Level at $0.22 and Resistance L...</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27280</link>
      <description>September 2nd: On Monday, September 2nd, WLFI went live and set off a trading frenzy. In just one hour, the trading volume exceeded $1 billion. After opening, the price soared to nearly the $0.40 range and then sharply dropped back to around $0.20 - $0.25 before rebounding. The WLFI liquidation heatmap shows that the range above $0.29 - $0.32 is a zone of high liquidity/orders, with a secondary peak at $0.36 - $0.40. There are also visible support levels around $0.22 - $0.24 and near $0.20. This event has directly linked political and wealth narratives to market frenzy.Bitunix Analyst Recommendation (Event Insights and Advice):WLFI&apos;s debut exposed three major risks.

Secondly, the strong connection of the project with political figures may attract regulatory and legal scrutiny. Thirdly, short-term trading heat does not equal sustainable fundament</description>
