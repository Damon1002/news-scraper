      <title>BiyaPay Analyst: Trump Propels Late-August &quot;Puzi Summit&quot; Tripartite Talks, Geopolitical News Pressure, Bitcoin Support Seen at $112,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25187</link>
      <description>On August 19th, during a meeting at the White House, US President Trump stated that he had reached a preliminary agreement with European leaders on the security guarantee for Ukraine. Subsequently, he had a phone call with Russian President Putin after the meeting. Trump disclosed that he is actively making arrangements for a direct meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky, which is scheduled to take place before the end of August. After this meeting, a trilateral talk involving himself will be promoted. US Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Pompeo, and Special Envoy Volker are currently working closely with both Russia and Ukraine.BiyaPay analysts believe that this round of diplomatic actions has sent a strong signal of relaxation, which may have an impact on the global capital market&apos;s risk appetite and thereby affect the price trend of Bitcoin. After the news was released, the price of Bitcoin briefly dropped to $114,400 but quickly rebounded above $115,000. Ho</description>

      <title>Goldman Sachs: Fed Expected to Cut Rates by 25 Basis Points in September, Five-Year Treasury Notes are the Best Trade Before Rate Cut</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25184</link>
      <description>On August 19th, Shifrin, the Global Head of Banking and Markets Strategy at Goldman Sachs, stated that while the Federal Reserve may cut rates, the five-year U.S. Treasury bond is currently the most attractive trading option. He pointed out that a yield range of 3%-4% for the five-year bond is a level worthy of investment and can also provide protection during periods of rising market risk.The current yield on the five-year U.S. Treasury bond is 3.85%, which is significantly lower than 4.38% at the beginning of the year. A Reuters survey shows that 61% of economists expect the Fed to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4%-4.25% range at the September meeting.Goldman Sachs predicts that considering the slowdown in real GDP growth and the rise in the unemployment rate, the Fed may start a rate cut cycle in the fourth quarter of 2025 and continue with accommodative policies in 2026, ultimately adjusting the policy rate to the 3%-3.25% level.
