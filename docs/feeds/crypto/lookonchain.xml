      <title>LD Capital Founder James: The next target for ETH is the $5000 ATH. It is expected that the upcoming halving expectations will usher in the Season of Quality Altcoins.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23814</link>
      <description>On August 9th, the founder of LD Capital, E Li Hua (Chris Li), stated on social media that after ETH broke through the $4000 double top resistance level, the new target is to break through the new high of $5000 and catch up to the exchange rate of BTC at $10,000. Certainly, the uptrend will not go in a straight line. He emphasized adhering to the bull market trend and the buy-the-dip strategy, and noted that the upcoming expectations of rate cuts will bring about the altcoin season.Subsequently, Ethereum&apos;s rise reached $4200. E Li Hua (Chris Li) stated that this kind of performance is in line with the bull markets of 2017 and 2020. Only ETH can bring investors back to the bull market. Holding onto ETH and avoiding shorting it will not cause investors to miss this bull market cycle.</description>
