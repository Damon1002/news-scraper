      <title>The U.S. CFTC has issued guidance on the Foreign Trading Platform Registration Framework, providing regulatory clarity for non-U.S. trading platforms seeking access to the U.S. market.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26757</link>
      <description>On August 29th, the Market Oversight Department of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued guidance on a Foreign-Based Trading Platform (FBOT) registration framework today. This framework is applicable to non-U.S. entities that are legally formed and operate outside the United States and wish to provide direct trading platform access to individuals located in the United States. The CFTC&apos;s FBOT registration framework is applicable to all markets, regardless of asset class, including traditional and digital asset markets.Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham stated: &quot;The release of today&apos;s FBOT guidance provides regulatory clarity for those who, due to the &apos;enforcement-based regulation&apos; of the past few years, have left U.S. trading activities and are now seeking a legal return to the United States.

      <title>The U.S. CFTC will issue guidance clarifying the rules for foreign trading platform registration.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26756</link>
      <description>On August 29th, Crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett disclosed that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is scheduled to issue guidance to clarify its Foreign Board of Trade (FBOT) registration rules. This provides a legal avenue for non-U.S. exchanges to enable U.S. users to trade on their platforms. Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham stated that this is a means to bring crypto activities &quot;back to the U.S.&quot; as such activities had previously flowed out due to enforcement actions during the Biden administration. At the same time, it reaffirms the regulatory framework that has been in place since the 1990s. For U.S. traders, this implies that they can legally access more global liquidity. For the crypto industry, this is another step towards regulatory clarity and is also part of the Trump administration&apos;s &quot;crypto sprint&quot; strategy.</description>
