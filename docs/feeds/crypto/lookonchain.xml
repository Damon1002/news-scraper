      <title>Tom Lee: Powell&apos;s Friday Speech May Be Understood by the Market as &quot;Dovish,&quot; While the Stock Market Will Rise After the Speech</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25337</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Tom Lee, the newly appointed Chairman of the Board of BitMine, posted on social media, indicating that during discussions with institutional investors, a greater number of people anticipate that Federal Reserve Chairman Powell will incline towards a &quot;hawkish&quot; stance in his speech this Friday. This is because he does not wish to be cornered into the situation of cutting interest rates. However, this is merely the &quot;baseline scenario,&quot; and the probability leans towards his statement being regarded as &quot;dovish,&quot; which implies that the stock market may rise after the Jackson Hole event.Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is scheduled to deliver a speech on the economic outlook and the evaluation of the Federal Reserve&apos;s policy framework at the annual central bank symposium of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (10 p.m. Beijing Time) on August 22nd.</description>

      <title>SEC Chair: Only a tiny number of tokens meet the definition of a security, ushering in a new era for the crypto industry</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25335</link>
      <description>On August 20th, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins recently restated his favorable stance towards cryptocurrency. He emphasized that &quot;a very small number&quot; of tokens fall into the securities category. This statement represents a significant change from the regulatory attitude of the previous administration.While attending a blockchain symposium in Wyoming on Tuesday, Paul Atkins clearly stated: &quot;The SEC will actively promote the new idea that tokens themselves may not necessarily and likely do not constitute securities. In my view, very few tokens truly meet the definition of securities, with the key depending on their ecosystem and method of sale.&quot;This statement comes as the latest policy signal from the SEC following the launch of &quot;Project Crypto&quot; last month. The project has been described by the chairman as a key part of securities law &quot;modernization&quot; reform, aiming to drive the U.S. financial markets towards on-chain transformation.Paul Atkins emphasized, &quot;Especially for the crypto indu</description>

      <title>Analyst: Data shows that options traders continue to remain optimistic, with the majority believing that the trend is not over yet</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25332</link>
      <description>August 20th. On-chain data analyst Murphy posted on social media, indicating that based on the &quot;Option Strike Heatmap&quot; data, on August 19th, there was a large-scale call option activity in the price range of $123,708 to $129,685. The total option premium size was approximately $43.32 million. At the same time, there was no net buying below the spot price, suggesting that traders were more inclined to bet on BTC rising to this range and there was little demand for put options, with almost no one actively purchasing downside protection.On the other hand, relatively larger-scale put options were sold in the price range of $97,709 to $102,430, and the total option premium size was approximately $13.14 million. This indicates that option sellers think it is unlikely for the price to drop to this level and choose to sell volatility.Therefore, the sentiment among option market traders remains optimistic. Most still believe that BTC&apos;s trend is not over and are betting that it can return to</description>
