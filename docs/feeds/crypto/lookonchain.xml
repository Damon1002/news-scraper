      <title>0xSun: If Ethereum cannot sustain its lead in the market, we may consider ending the &quot;long ETH, short various altcoins&quot; strategy</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27126</link>
      <description>On September 1st, Smart Money, the crypto KOL 0xsun.sol (@0xSunNFT) summarized the &quot;Long ETH, Short Shitcoins&quot; strategy on social media. They said, &quot;In general, this strategy has been very successful, especially when facing market volatility. In the last few days of August, due to SOL&apos;s sudden strength, which led the altcoins, the profits of the strategy suffered some drawdowns. We will continue to observe. If this situation persists for a while and ETH cannot lead the market, we can consider taking profits.&quot;Furthermore, regarding on-chain operations, 0xSun mentioned, &quot;Currently, because the listing channel cannot be opened, there is a limited ceiling. It is still a good choice for small funds, but the cost-effectiveness for large funds is too low. Liquidity injection is needed, or some iconic events to open up the ceiling to improve this situation.&quot;</description>
