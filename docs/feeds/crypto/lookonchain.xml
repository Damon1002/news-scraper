      <title>Analyst: Fed Rate Cut in September Unlikely to Be Derailed by Worsening Inflation Data</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27893</link>
      <description>On September 5th, Analyst Chris Anstey stated that prior to the Non-Farm Payrolls report, the market had fully factored in a Fed rate cut two weeks later. In order to dissuade traders from this expectation, it might require extremely strong job growth data along with a high CPI report. Nevertheless, this job report might have already solidified the rate cut expectation, even if the forthcoming CPI indicates escalating inflation. (FXStreet)</description>
