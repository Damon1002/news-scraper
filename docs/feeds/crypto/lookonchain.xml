      <title>RMRK Founder: The Trump Family is the New Age &quot;Mafia&quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27972</link>
      <description>On September 6th, the WLFI token of RMRK founder Bruno Skvorc was frozen by the WLFI team. The WLFI team responded that &quot;the addressed in question is suspected of engaging in high-risk blockchain activities and cannot be unfrozen.&quot;Bruno Skvorc stated, &quot;They stole my money. Since this incident involves the Trump family, I can do nothing about it. This is the new era of the Mafia. There is nowhere to appeal, no one to reason with, and no one to sue. That&apos;s how it is... This is the true king of scams.&quot;On-chain detective ZachXBT responded to this incident, saying, &quot;The problem is that most of the time, the judgment exposed as &apos;high-risk&apos; is actually incorrect. Therefore, teams cannot overly rely on compliance tools.

      <title>BiyaPay Analyst: US August Non-Farm Payrolls Data Disappointing, Bitcoin Weekly Chart Shows Weakness, Possible Support at $93,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27966</link>
      <description>September 6th: On the evening of September 5th, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics made an announcement. Only 22,000 non-farm jobs were added in August, which is much lower than the market&apos;s expectation of 75,000. The unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, reaching a new high since the end of 2021.This weak employment data has led to a decline in the U.S. dollar and a rise in gold prices, causing volatility in the short-term trend of Bitcoin. Looking at the latest Bitcoin candlestick chart, the weekly chart of BTC is showing a clear downward trend. It has been closing below key support levels for several consecutive weeks. The short-term moving averages are trending downward, and there is a clear bearish crossover in the MACD, indicating a weakening of the bullish momentum. From a technical perspective, if Bitcoin fails to hold above the $100,000 psychological level, the immediate support below may first test the range of $96,000 to $98,000. Further breakdown could extend to around $93,000</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27969</link>
      <description>September 6th. During this week, the financial markets underwent significant changes. The surprise weakness in the U.S. nonfarm payroll data led to an increase in the expectation of a Fed rate cut. Despite the market&apos;s anticipation of further rate cuts by the Fed, the U.S. dollar surprisingly remained strong and did not experience a significant drop even after the disappointing nonfarm payroll data.Several Fed watchers have stated that this U.S. nonfarm payroll data has confirmed a rate cut this month. Investors hold the same view, which has boosted the probability of a rate cut at this month&apos;s meeting to 99%.Monday, 23:00: The 1-year inflation expectation of the U.S. New York Fed for August;Tuesday, 22:00: The nonfarm employment benchmark revision for 2025 in the U.S.;Wednesday, 20:30: U.S. August PPI data;Wednesday, 22:00: U.S. July Wholesale Sales month-on-month;Thursday, 20:30: U.S. August CPI data and U.S. Initial Jobless Claims up to September 6th;Friday, 22:00: The init</description>
