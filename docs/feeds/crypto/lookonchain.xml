      <title>Standard Chartered Bank: Ethereum Poised to Break Above $4,000 in Treasury Purchase Trend</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22283</link>
      <description>On July 29th, Geoff Kendrick, the Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered Bank, stated that as cryptocurrency treasury companies continue to purchase Ethereum, Ethereum is anticipated to experience further growth. Cryptocurrency treasury companies, which are publicly listed companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets, have begun to integrate Ethereum into their asset allocations, and the institutional buying of Ethereum has even exceeded that of Bitcoin.He mentioned that due to the continuous restrictions on cryptocurrency asset investments in many jurisdictions, investors are increasingly turning to alternative channels such as public companies for allocation. &quot;If the inflow of funds can be sustained, Ethereum is expected to break through the key level of $4000 (our current end-of-2025 price prediction).&quot; (Kryptonian)</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22278</link>
      <description>On July 29th, as per the report by CoinDesk, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, recently advised investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to Bitcoin or gold. He did this by citing the growing debt burden in the United States and the risks associated with long-term currency devaluation.Dalio stated on the &quot;Master Investor&quot; podcast, &quot;If you aim to optimize the risk-return ratio of your portfolio, then approximately 15% of your funds should be allocated to gold or Bitcoin.&quot;This perspective represents a notable shift from his 2022 recommendation of only a 1–2% Bitcoin allocation, which reflects his increasing worry about the so-called &quot;debt crisis loop.&quot; He pointed out that the United States is projected to issue an additional $12 trillion in new national debt within the next year in order to address the current $36.7 trillion national debt.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22277</link>
      <description>July 29th: The U.S. Trade Representative, Grier, stated that the U.S. and India need to engage in more negotiations prior to the tariff deadline on August 1st and approach with caution regarding the possibility of reaching an agreement. Although India had previously expressed a willingness to impose zero tariffs on certain goods, it has set red lines for core industries such as agriculture and dairy. In the event that trade frictions escalate, it may have an impact on global market risk sentiment. In the crypto market, the price of BTC rebounded after testing 117,400 multiple times yesterday and is currently fluctuating within the range of 118,000 - 120,000.Bitunix analyst&apos;s suggestion: The deadlock in U.S.-India negotiations has heightened the demand for safe-haven assets, and BTC still has short-term support; however, the upward momentum is limited. It is recommended that investors focus on the support level near 118,000 and strictly manage stop-loss; if the price fails to effectiv</description>
