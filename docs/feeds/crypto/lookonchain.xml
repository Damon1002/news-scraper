      <title>「Fed&apos;s Signal Booster」: Rate Cut Threshold Shifts, but July CPI Still Insufficient to Prevent September Rate Cut</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24246</link>
      <description>On August 12th, Nick Timiraos, a Wall Street Journal reporter renowned as the &quot;Fed Whisperer&quot;, declared that the rate cut threshold had undergone a transformation following the release of today&apos;s CPI data. The rate cut plan for September might be impeded by today&apos;s CPI data, which was higher than expected. The CPI data from July did not suggest &quot;no inflation&quot;, yet it might not be sufficient to prevent a rate cut in September.</description>

      <title>Trump Urges Rate Cut Again, Threatens Major Lawsuit Against Powell</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24245</link>
      <description>On August 12th, Trump once more posted on Truth Social and urged a rate cut, saying, &quot;Jerome, it&apos;s too late. Powell must immediately lower interest rates. He is always &apos;too late&apos;, resulting in immeasurable losses. Fortunately, the economic situation is excellent. We have completely gotten rid of Powell and the complacent Federal Reserve. However, I am considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell because he has done a terrible job in managing the construction of the Fed. He is extremely incompetent. This project should have only needed a $50 million repair, but it ended up costing $3 billion. It&apos;s truly awful!&quot;</description>
