      <title>Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Officially Unveils &quot;Truth&quot; Token-Related Plans</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22988</link>
      <description>On August 3rd, according to DL News, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) officially presented its plans for the Truth brand utility token and digital wallet in the most recent filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As early as several months ago, the company hinted at this concept in a letter to its shareholders.The filing shows that the token will be a part of a &quot;more extensive reward plan&quot; and integrated into the &quot;Truth digital wallet&quot;. Its initial uses involve paying for Truth+ subscription fees. As the project advances, the token may also be applicable to other products and services within the Truth ecosystem, suggesting that it may have a broader range of uses across the entire platform in the future.Although the filing does not directly refer to it as &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;, the wording implies that it is likely to be built on blockchain infrastructure. This second-quarter earnings report is the first time this project has appeared in public</description>
