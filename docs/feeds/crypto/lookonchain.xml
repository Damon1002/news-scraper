      <description>On August 4th, according to Coinglass data, the current funding rates of mainstream CEX and DEX show a divergent market trend, with both bearish and neutral sentiments. The specific funding rates for mainstream coins are shown in the attached image.BlockBeats Note: The funding rate is a fee set by cryptocurrency trading platforms to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price. It is usually applicable to perpetual contracts and is a mechanism for the exchange of funds between long and short traders. The trading platform does not charge this fee. It is used to adjust the cost or profit of traders holding contracts to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.When the funding rate is 0.01%, it represents the baseline rate. When the funding rate is greater than 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market. When the funding rate is less than 0.005%, it signifies a generally bearish market.</description>
