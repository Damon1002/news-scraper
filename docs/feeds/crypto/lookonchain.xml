      <title>If Bitcoin drops below $110,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation pressure will reach $735 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26826</link>
      <description>On August 29th, according to Coinglass data, if Bitcoin drops below $110,000, the cumulative intensity of long liquidation on mainstream CEXs will reach 735 million.Conversely, if Bitcoin surpasses $112,000, the cumulative intensity of short liquidation on mainstream CEXs will only be 102 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not accurately depict the number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the asset price reaching a certain point will be impacted. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price reaching that level will trigger a more intense reaction due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>

      <title>Matrixport September Outlook: Bitcoin Consolidation Expected to Continue for 2-3 Weeks Until New Catalyst Drives Price Movement</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26824</link>
      <description>August 29th. Matrixport presented the September market outlook, indicating that Bitcoin is currently in a stage where technical and macro factors are intermingled. The rare decline in August and the typically poor seasonal performance in September. This month will witness key events such as non-farm payroll data, CPI, and the Fed&apos;s interest rate meeting, which further increase uncertainty. Even if the Fed decides to cut interest rates, the market may not necessarily witness the expected rebound.Currently, Bitcoin is fluctuating in a crucial range at the boundary between the bullish and bearish sides, and most investors are choosing to wait and see. The key issue to be addressed next is whether this round of volatility is merely a period of consolidation or a precursor to a trend reversal. Bitcoin&apos;s consolidation phase is expected to continue for another 2-3 weeks until new catalytic factors drive price movements. Since August, Bitcoin has dropped by 3.9%, which is significantly lower</description>
