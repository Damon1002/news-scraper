      <title>Survey Results Show One Quarter of UK Adults Would Include Cryptocurrency in Their Retirement Plan</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26452</link>
      <description>August 27th. According to Cointelegraph, the latest survey by insurance company Aviva indicates that 27% of UK adults are willing to incorporate cryptocurrency into their retirement investment portfolio. Moreover, 23% are even thinking about withdrawing their existing pensions for crypto investment. Approximately one-fifth of the respondents stated that they already hold or have held cryptocurrency, with the 25 - 34 age group being the most active. Although attracted by the high potential for returns, investors still have concerns about security risks (41%), the lack of regulation (37%), and price volatility (30), among other issues.In May this year, the UK proposed a crypto regulatory framework. Meanwhile, the United States has already permitted 401(k) retirement plans to include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The UK&apos;s pension market is valued at $5.12 trillion. If it opens up channels for crypto investment, it may lead to significant inflows of funds into the crypto market.</description>
