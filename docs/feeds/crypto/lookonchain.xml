      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4200, the cumulative long liquidation strength of major CEXs will reach $1.53 billion.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27425</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, the cryptocurrency market remains on a downward trajectory. According to Coinglass data, in the event that Ethereum drops below $4200, the cumulative intensity of long liquidation in mainstream CEXs will reach $1.553 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum surges above $4400, the cumulative intensity of short liquidation in mainstream CEXs will reach $0.940 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not precisely depict the number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent clusters, that is, intensity. Consequently, the liquidation chart showcases the degree to which the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it attains a certain level. Higher &quot;liquidation bars&quot; indicate that when the price reaches that level, it will experience a more pronounced reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
