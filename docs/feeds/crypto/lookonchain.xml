      <title>Japanese Financial Regulator Proposes to Include Cryptocurrency in Securities Regulations</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27689</link>
      <description>On September 4th, as per Cointelegraph, on Tuesday, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan issued a report suggesting that the regulation of cryptocurrencies should be transferred from the &quot;Payment Services Act&quot; to the more rigorous &quot;Financial Instruments and Exchange Act&quot; (FIEA) framework. This action is intended to enhance investor protection, address issues such as unclear information disclosure, unregistered operations, and security vulnerabilities within the industry, and bring cryptocurrency regulation in line with securities regulation.The report shows that in Japan, there are already over 12 million cryptocurrency accounts, with total user deposits reaching 5 trillion yen (approximately 33.7 billion US dollars). If the new regulations come into effect, cryptocurrency issuers will be subject to stricter disclosure requirements, and intermediary services will also be under more intense oversight.

      <title>Tom Lee: Fed Could Cut Rates in September, Stock Market Expected to Rally</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27688</link>
      <description>On September 4th, Tom Lee, the Chairman of BitMine&apos;s Board of Directors, stated in a Macro Minute video that although the market is widely concerned that September will witness a decline due to seasonal factors and the risk of a potential increase in VIX, he thinks the most appropriate approach is for the Federal Reserve to maintain its stance of inaction this year and start cutting rates in September. This will be beneficial to the stock market.The Federal Reserve has maintained a pause on rate hikes for the most part of this year. It is anticipated that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in September, similar to what occurred in 1998 and 2024. In both these historical contexts, the market subsequently experienced a significant rebound, especially in the performance approaching the end of the year. Hence, Tom Lee has offered a &quot;contrarian&quot; assessment that goes against the general sentiment of the market: September 2025 may bring about a bullish market.</description>

      <title>Justin Sun: No Reason to Doubt High-Yield Staking, Interest Subsidized by Corporate Profits</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27680</link>
      <description>On September 4th, Justin Sun responded to the inquiries regarding the &quot;Huobi HTX High-Yield Financial Product&quot; as follows:Similar to the popular instant rewards (free lunch) in the current industry, the high-yield interest rate is 100% subsidized by the group. This is essentially done to compete for users among trading platforms. The subsidy logic is also very straightforward: user growth leads to trading volume growth, which is worthwhile in the long run.Huobi HTX is still in the early stage of growth and will consider other factors after increasing asset immersion.The Merkel Tree proof has been released for nearly 34 months, ensuring fund transparency.The current group has an annual profit of tens of billions of US dollars. Therefore, no one should question our ability to subsidize, right?Finally, Justin Sun stated that there is no reason to question the Huobi HTX demand deposit financial product as funds can be withdrawn directly.</description>
