The 30-day momentum decreased to +3%, and the ADX slid to 36, indicating a weakening short-term bullish momentum. On-chain activity decreased, but exchange outflows still showed ongoing accumulation in the market.Despite the intensified short-term volatility, the structural bullish thesis remains unchanged.

      <title>Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Officially Unveils &quot;Truth&quot; Token-Related Plans</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22988</link>
      <description>On August 3rd, according to DL News, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) officially presented its plans for the Truth brand utility token and digital wallet in the most recent filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As early as several months ago, the company hinted at this concept in a letter to its shareholders.The filing shows that the token will be a part of a &quot;more extensive reward plan&quot; and integrated into the &quot;Truth digital wallet&quot;. Its initial uses involve paying for Truth+ subscription fees. As the project advances, the token may also be applicable to other products and services within the Truth ecosystem, suggesting that it may have a broader range of uses across the entire platform in the future.Although the filing does not directly refer to it as &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;, the wording implies that it is likely to be built on blockchain infrastructure. This second-quarter earnings report is the first time this project has appeared in public</description>

      <description>On August 3rd, as reported by Caixin, a source close to the applicant for the Hong Kong stablecoin license disclosed that with the finalization of regulatory rules, the Hong Kong stablecoin craze will wane.

Some industry insiders have indicated that Bank of China Hong Kong, as one of Hong Kong&apos;s three note-issuing banks, would have a natural advantage if it were to issue a stablec</description>
