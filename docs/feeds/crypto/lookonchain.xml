      <title>If Bitcoin breaks $112,000, the mainstream CEX combined short liquidation volume will reach $1.291 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26328</link>
      <description>On August 26th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin surmounts $112,000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach $1.291 billion. In contrast, if Bitcoin descends below $108,000, the cumulative long liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will attain $1.048 billion.**BlockBeats Note**: The liquidation chart does not exhibit the precise number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts that have been liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually signify the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent ones, that is, the intensity.Consequently, the liquidation chart demonstrates to what degree the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a particular level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will undergo a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade when it reaches that specific point.</description>
