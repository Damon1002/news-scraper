      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26740</link>
      <description>On Thursday local time, August 28th, the European Commission proposed to lift import tariffs on U.S. industrial goods as part of a trade deal with the United States.

This proposal is the initial step in implementing a framework agreement reached between U.S. President Trump and European Commission President von der Leyen on July 27th. Under the agreement, the EU agreed to impose a 15% tariff on a wide range of goods to prevent a destructive trade war. The U.S. has agreed to reduce tariffs on EU-produced cars from 27.5% to 15% starting from the first day of the month following the EU&apos;s submission of the legislative proposal, which was August 1st.
