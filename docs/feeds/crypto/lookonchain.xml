      <title>The Ethereum Foundation will pause open grant applications and redesign the grant program.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26911</link>
      <description>On August 29th, the Ethereum Foundation stated in a post that its grant program was launched in 2018 and has gradually transformed into the Ecosystem Support Program (ESP). The purpose of ESP is to assist the Ethereum ecosystem in thriving by providing grants and support. By 2024, through the public grant program web form, ESP had allocated nearly $3 million to 105 projects and initiatives.In order to better align with EF&apos;s updated ecosystem development strategy, the Foundation is adjusting the priorities and approach of ESP. As part of this transition, the open grant application process has been temporarily paused. This change will give the Foundation time to redesign the program, shifting the focus from a reactive mode to a more proactive mode while supporting the priorities of other EF teams. Funding for Ethereum public goods will continue, and applications will still be accepted, but in a new format. Further details will be announced in future posts.</description>

      <title>If Bitcoin falls below $107,000, the mainstream CEX long liquidation pressure will reach $1.127 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26906</link>
      <description>On August 29th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin drops beneath $107,000, the cumulative intensity of long liquidation on mainstream CEXs will reach $1.127 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin surpasses $110,000, the cumulative intensity of short liquidation on mainstream CEXs will merely be $186 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not disclose the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to the adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what extent the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it attains a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price, once reached, will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <description>On August 29th, the U.S. stock market maintained its downward trend, with the Nasdaq declining by 1.00%.Joanne Hsu, the director of the University of Michigan Consumer Survey, said that the final value of the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index was in line with the preliminary value, showing a decrease of approximately 6% from July.
