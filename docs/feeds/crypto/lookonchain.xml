      <title>If Bitcoin breaks $121,000, the mainstream CEX cumulative short liquidation pressure will reach $1.145 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22120</link>
      <description>On July 28th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin manages to break through $121,000, the total short liquidation intensity across mainstream CEXs will amount to $1.145 billion.Conversely, if Bitcoin drops below $117,000, the total long liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach $1.594 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not disclose the exact number of contracts set to be liquidated or the precise value of those contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, the intensity.Consequently, the liquidation chart showcases the extent to which the asset price reaching a certain level will be impacted. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, it will trigger a more intense reaction due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>

      <title>10x Research: Bitcoin to Provide Better Risk-Reward Entry Point if Pullback Reaches May High Support</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22119</link>
      <description>On July 28th, Markus Thielen, the director of 10x Research, stated that for traders aiming to participate in Bitcoin&apos;s upward trend, waiting for Bitcoin to retrace to the high support level near $111,673 in May will offer a better risk-reward entry point.In a report sent to clients, Thielen pointed out, &quot;We expect Bitcoin to retest its breakout level at $111,673 in order to provide a more favorable risk/reward entry point.&quot; He explained that the market frequently retests breakout points before a significant bull run, so the possibility of a retracement to this level cannot be ignored. Thielen further added that if a significant pullback does not take place, the optimal entry point would be above the $120,000 breakout, which marks the breakout of the downtrend line from the highs on July 14th and 23rd.</description>

      <title>UBS: Prepare for Potential Market Volatility</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22117</link>
      <description>On July 28th, UBS Wealth Management Investment Office stated that since the peak of concerns triggered by the U.S. tariff policy in April, the S&amp;P 500 Index has witnessed a nearly 30% increase. This reveals that investors are increasingly convinced that the U.S. will reach a compromise with its major trading partners. Recent data also shows that the U.S. economy has maintained its resilience, and market sentiment has been boosted by top tech companies continuously increasing their capital expenditures in artificial intelligence.UBS also warned that the recent significant gains in the past few weeks have already factored in a lot of potential positive news, and investors should be prepared for possible market volatility in the coming weeks. While the market will be encouraged by the increased certainty of U.S.-EU trade, the level of U.S. tariffs still remains about six times higher than the pre-Liberation Day level. The economic impact of these tariffs is currently unfolding, and unce</description>

      <title>The AI Agent Platform Bankr is currently developing an API to support agent-based encrypted payments and an information layer.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22116</link>
      <description>On July 28th, the AI agent platform Bankr disclosed that it is in the process of developing the Bankr API. This API will enable agents or apps to utilize Bankr as a cryptographic payment or information layer. In the first phase, BNKR is used to pay for each query via x402 and obtain transaction data execution. In the second phase, wallet creation is supported, and it is completely controlled by the agent or app through Bankr.BlockBeats reported previously that on July 24th, Coinbase Ventures announced that it would provide support to Bankr through the Base Ecosystem Fund. Bankr is one of the agent platforms integrated into Coinbase&apos;s newly launched Base app. Transaction agents respond more quickly than humans, operate 24/7, and are capable of making more data-driven decisions.</description>
