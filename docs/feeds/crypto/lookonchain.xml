      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22525</link>
      <description>July 30: The U.S. Department of Justice made an announcement that a Canadian individual received a one-year prison sentence the previous day due to conspiracy to commit telecommunications fraud, telecommunications fraud, and conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft.Based on court documents, 22-year-old Cameron Albert Redman devised a plan to steal non-fungible tokens (NFTs). He achieved this by illegally accessing the X accounts of multiple digital artists. Redman and his accomplices employed these artists&apos; online identities to redirect their fans to a fraudulent website. On this website, the victims thought they were authorizing a transaction to have the NFTs transferred to their digital wallets, but in fact, they were unknowingly enabling the conspirators to steal cryptocurrency and NFTs from their wallets. It is reported that Cameron Albert Redman and his associates defrauded more than 200 victims and made a profit of over $794,000.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22517</link>
      <description>On July 30th, Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, stated in a post on Wednesday that an early user of Telegram and Toncoin (TON) had recently received a $25 million offer to purchase their &quot;crypto&quot; username on Telegram.The username was originally bought for $350,000 in 2023. The username holder also recently said, &quot;If these cannot be taken away by others, then I want to own all rare usernames.&quot; - This is the quote that Durov referenced in the post.All usernames on Telegram are tokenized on the TON blockchain, meaning each username is unique and cannot be replicated.
