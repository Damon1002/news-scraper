      <title>Economist: Federal Reserve Subjected to Trump&apos;s &quot;Full-Scale Assault,&quot; Its Independence Is a Key Factor in Maintaining the Safe Haven Status of US Treasury Bonds and the Dollar</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26294</link>
      <description>On August 26th, Saul Eslake, who was formerly the chief economist of Merrill Lynch in Australia, stated that the dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard signaled a clear intensification of White House intervention following President Trump&apos;s efforts to reshape the US federal government and its institutions. He further added that loyalty appears to be a standard for continuing to hold high public office. The independence of the Federal Reserve is a crucial factor in maintaining the safe haven status of US Treasuries and the US dollar. The Federal Reserve is now facing full-fledged attacks, and this will not lead to any favorable outcomes. (FX678)</description>

      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4300, the mainstream CEX liquidation pressure will reach $922 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26292</link>
      <description>On August 26th, based on Coinglass data, if Ethereum falls below $4300, the cumulative long liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach 922 million.Conversely, if Ethereum breaks through $4600, the cumulative short liquidation intensity of mainstream CEXs will reach 1.986 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring liquidation clusters, that is, strength. Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will have a more intense reaction due to a liquidity avalanche when it reaches that level.</description>

      <title>National Committee of the Chinese People&apos;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Yao Zhisheng: Hong Kong should strive to become a global stablecoin issuance center</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26287</link>
      <description>August 26th. According to the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, Yao Zhisheng, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People&apos;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), published an article titled &quot;Focusing on Three Themes to Promote High-Quality Development in Hong Kong.&quot; In this article, it was pointed out that stablecoins pegged to fiat currency possess the characteristics such as openness, transparency, decentralization, and globalization that are endowed by blockchain technology and distributed ledgers. At the same time, they also have the feature of maintaining the value of fiat currency. Hong Kong, as an international financial center and the world&apos;s largest offshore RMB business center, should make good use of the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; advantage, seize the strategic high ground in stablecoin development, strive to become a global hub for stablecoin issuance, and enhance its role as a &quot;digital financial hub.&quot;</description>
