      <title>British Retail Investors to Be Able to Purchase Cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Notes in October</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22977</link>
      <description>On August 3rd, as per the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the UK, a new regulation that is scheduled to come into effect on October 8th will enable UK retail investors to be able to purchase cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (cETNs) soon. cETNs must be listed on an FCA-approved UK trading platform and adhere to financial promotion and consumer responsibility regulations. While retail users are permitted to use cETNs, they will not be encompassed by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.The UK Financial Conduct Authority had previously prohibited retail investors from accessing cryptocurrency ETNs in 2021 due to concerns regarding investor protection matters.

      <title>Due to factors such as the shockingly low nonfarm payroll data in the US, the probability of a Fed rate cut in September surged to 80.3%.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22972</link>
      <description>On August 3rd, this week in the US, only 73,000 non-farm jobs were added in July, which was much lower than expected. The data for June and May were also revised downward significantly. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Board Member Cugler will resign next week, enabling Trump to appoint a preferred candidate earlier.Perhaps affected by the above news, on the CME &quot;FedWatch&quot; tool, the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September soared to 80.3%. Before the non-farm payroll data, this figure was only 41.3%.</description>

There was a recent peak of 744,000 ETH.
