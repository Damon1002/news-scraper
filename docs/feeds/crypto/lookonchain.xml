      <title>QCP Capital: If global economic growth remains robust, the US dollar is highly likely to weaken from here</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27528</link>
      <description>September 3rd - QCP Capital announced in its official channel that with the advent of September, the market&apos;s focus has transitioned from the magnitude of the rate cut to the independence of the Fed. The increase in term premia and the lowering of the threshold for the USD downcycle suggest a steepening yield curve, a weaker dollar, and offer support for gold and Bitcoin as hedging instruments.The Jackson Hole meeting has redirected the focus towards a risk-oriented cooling of the labor market, making a September rate cut still a potential outcome. Two rate cuts within the year appear reasonable; currently, investors need to keep a close eye on the balance between the inflation rate and tariff-driven inflation expectations. If global economic growth remains strong, the dollar is very likely to weaken from this point onwards.</description>
