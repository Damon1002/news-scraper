      <title>Pudgy Penguins Clarification: Did Not Acquire OpenSea</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21952</link>
      <description>On July 26th, Beau, the security lead of Pudgy Penguins, posted a clarification stating, &quot;Pudgy Penguins did not acquire Opensea... Please stay calm.The scale of the Penguin Plan that we have in mind is far greater than your speculation about an acquisition.

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21946</link>
      <description>On July 26th, according to Coinglass data, the current funding rates of mainstream CEXs and DEXs show that the market remains in a neutral state. The specific funding rates for mainstream coins are presented in the attached image.BlockBeats Note: The funding rate is a fee set by cryptocurrency exchanges to maintain the balance between the contract price and the underlying asset price. It is usually applicable to perpetual contracts and is a mechanism for the exchange of funds between long and short traders. The trading platform does not charge this fee. It is used to adjust the cost or profit of traders holding contracts to keep the contract price close to the underlying asset price.When the funding rate is 0.01%, it represents the benchmark rate. When the funding rate is greater than 0.01%, it indicates a generally bullish market. When the funding rate is less than 0.005%, it indicates a generally bearish market.</description>
