      <title>Point of View: The GENIUS Act is Driving Stablecoins Towards Payment Applications, Potentially Spawning a Wave of &quot;Killer Apps&quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22010</link>
      <description>On July 27th, Fabian Dori, the Chief Investment Officer of Sygnum, stated that the GENIUS Act will bring about a transformation in the stablecoin landscape. This will prompt issuers to shift from a yield-oriented model to a payment use case. The revised bill makes a clear distinction between interest-bearing stablecoins and payment-use stablecoins, bringing the U.S. framework closer to the EU&apos;s MiCA regulation and laying the foundation for a &quot;global consensus.&quot; Dori believes that regulatory clarity will stimulate institutions to develop innovative &quot;killer applications,&quot; thereby generating a whole new demand for payment services.
