      <title>「Trump Fires Fed Board Member Powell Case」 to be Defended by Washington Legal Legend Abbe Lowell on behalf of Powell</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27474</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, the &quot;Case of Trump Firing Fed Chair Powell&quot; will be defended by Abbe Lowell, a legendary lawyer in Washington, on behalf of Powell.It is reported that Lowell&apos;s past clients have included New York Attorney General Letitia James, Hunter Biden, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and many other high-profile political figures, regardless of their party affiliations (whether they are Republicans or Democrats).For Lowell, facing a presidential administration&apos;s attempt to control the actions of a federal regulatory agency is not a new situation. He has been deeply involved in the Washington legal community for decades. Lowell stated in an MSNBC interview last month, &quot;I have basically challenged the overreach of every government agency in every administration since Ronald Reagan. Whether it is a Democratic or Republican government, if the government overreaches, it is the duty of a lawyer to bring it back on track.&quot; (Golden Finance)</description>
