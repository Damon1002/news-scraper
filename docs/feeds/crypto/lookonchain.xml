      <title>Dragonfly Partner Responds to Potential US Department of Justice Charges: Fully Intends to Defend Itself</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21898</link>
      <description>On July 26th, Haseeb, a partner of Dragonfly, responded to the news that &quot;The U.S. Department of Justice is considering charging DragonFly employees in the Tornado Cash case&quot; by stating, &quot;Dragonfly invested in PepperSec, Inc., the developer of Tornado Cash, in August 2020. This was because they recognized the importance of open-source privacy protection technology. Prior to the investment, Dragonfly obtained external legal advice confirming that the development of Tornado Cash was in compliance with the law and in line with the guidelines issued by FinCEN, an agency of the U.S. Treasury Department, in 2019. The U.S. government has publicly stated in court that they are considering charges against Dragonfly. Based on legal advice, we have decided not to make public comments at this time, but we have chosen not to remain silent.&quot;&quot;We firmly believe that Americans have the right to privacy. The lack of privacy remains one of the biggest unresolved problems in the cryptocurrency field. Th</description>

      <title>Coinbase CEO Clarifies Addition of RSC to Listing Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21895</link>
      <description>On July 26th, Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, clarified the announcement &quot;Coinbase to Add ResearchCoin (RSC) to Listing Roadmap&quot;:&quot;We, as the co-founder of ResearchHub, would like to share some details about the precautions we took a few years ago to eliminate conflicts of interest. All assets listed on Coinbase go through the review of our Digital Asset Support Group (DASG). DASG conducts a review of all assets listed on Coinbase from legal, compliance, and cybersecurity perspectives. I am not a member of DASG, so I do not have voting power to decide which assets receive listing approval. My relationship with ResearchHub has been disclosed to the Coinbase Board, which is a standard practice. I wrote a blog post on this topic in March 2022 and publicly committed not to sell RSC for at least four years, and this commitment remains unchanged.&quot;</description>

      <title>The US Department of Justice is considering charging DragonFly employees in the Tornado Cash case.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21889</link>
      <description>On July 25th, as per crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett, in the latest trial update regarding Tornado Cash&apos;s co-founder and developer Roman Storm, Assistant Prosecutor Rehn disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) seemingly is still in the process of considering bringing charges against an undisclosed number of DragonFly&apos;s employees. It is not merely limited to DragonFly&apos;s General Partner Tom Schmidt.Dragonfly is the venture capital firm that backs Tornado Cash. Yesterday in court, emails between Roman Storm and DragonFly&apos;s General Partner Tom Schmidt were presented. One of the emails showed that Storm and his team were seeking feedback on adding Know Your Customer (KYC) to the platform. The defense had requested Schmidt to testify, but he invoked the Fifth Amendment right through his lawyer (the right to refuse to testify). The trial will continue next week, and more information is expected at that time. Closing arguments are also anticipated to take place next week.</description>
