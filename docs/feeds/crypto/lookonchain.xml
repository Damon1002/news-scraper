      <title>Canada to Lift Retaliatory Tariffs on the U.S., Extending an Olive Branch to Trump</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25822</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, Canada is going to lift the retaliatory tariffs on a large number of American products that meet the existing North American Free Trade Agreement. This is intended to ease tensions with the White House. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is expected to make this announcement on Friday after a cabinet meeting. According to sources familiar with the matter and requesting anonymity, the government will adjust its tariff policy to be more in line with the United States&apos; measures.This indicates that many American consumer goods will no longer be subject to a 25% tariff when exported to Canada as long as they comply with the terms of the USMCA. However, the Canadian government may keep a 25% import tariff on American steel and aluminum products, as well as tariffs on American automobiles. Former President Trump had imposed tariffs on these industries. (Soochow Securities)</description>

      <title>Jump Crypto has proposed the DFBA mechanism to address the challenges of traditional CLOBs on the blockchain.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25818</link>
      <description>On August 23rd, the research team of market maker Jump Crypto published an article putting forward a new trading mechanism named Dual Flow Batch Auction (DFBA), with the aim of addressing the challenges faced by traditional Continuous Limit Order Books (CLOBs) on the blockchain.It is reported that CLOBs rely on continuous matching and a time priority mechanism, which gives rise to latency arbitrage, MEV (Miner Extractable Value) issues, and adverse trading liquidity, thereby increasing market trading costs.DFBA conducts two independent auctions every 100 milliseconds. It divides orders into Maker and Taker groups and completes transactions at a single fair settlement price. This mechanism eliminates the time priority, avoids competition among liquidity providers, and shifts the competitive focus from speed to price and scale.Compared to traditional designs, DFBA can provide tighter quotes, deeper liquidity. At the same time, it protects natural traders from the impacts of latency</description>

      <title>Viewpoint: It is expected to have a total interest rate cut of 75 basis points by the end of the year</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25815</link>
      <description>On August 22nd, Kathy Bostjancic, the chief economist of Nationwide, stated that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a total of 75 basis points before the end of the year. She pointed out, &quot;Powell has adopted a noticeably more dovish tone and significantly opened the door to a rate cut in September. He sees that the downside risks to employment are rising significantly. This supports our view that there will be a 25 basis points rate cut next month. We also continue to expect that by the end of the year, the Fed will have cut rates by a total of 75 basis points because the labor market will further weaken and the rise in inflation is only moderate and temporary.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
