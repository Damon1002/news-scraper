      <title>WSJ: Trump Family Accumulates $5 Billion in Paper Wealth After WLFI IPO</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27235</link>
      <description>On September 2nd, as per The Wall Street Journal, the Trump family witnessed a whopping $5 billion surge in their net worth on Monday. This occurred when their leading cryptocurrency project initiated the trading of a new digital currency.This trading debut is probably the Trump family&apos;s most significant achievement in the financial sector since Trump assumed office. Currently, the Trump family (including Trump himself) collectively holds slightly less than a quarter of the WLFI token. Trump&apos;s three sons are co-founders of World Liberty, with Trump himself holding the title of &quot;Honorary Co-Founder.&quot;World Liberty declared that the tokens held by the founders and team members are still locked, meaning they cannot be sold. However, this trading launch has bestowed a real market valuation upon their held tokens. Previously, the value of these tokens was solely based on private transactions.Today, WLFI is likely to have become the most valuable asset of the Trump family, surpas</description>

      <title>If Ethereum drops below $4200, the overall Long/Short ratio on mainstream CEXs will reach a liquidation volume of 928 million dollars.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27232</link>
      <description>September 2nd: The cryptocurrency market maintained its downward trend. Based on Coinglass data, in the event that Ethereum drops below $4200, the cumulative long liquidation strength of mainstream CEXs will reach $928 million.Conversely, if Ethereum surges above $4400, the cumulative short liquidation strength of mainstream CEXs will reach $539 million.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually signify the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring clusters, that is, the strength. Hence, the liquidation chart illustrates to what extent the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a specific level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>
