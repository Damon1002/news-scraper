      <title>The amount of ETH queued for exiting the Ethereum PoS network has decreased for 3 consecutive days, with the current value being approximately 17.85 billion USD worth of ETH in the exit queue.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23182</link>
      <description>On August 5th, based on the data from the Validator Queue tracking website validatorqueue, the current exit queue on the Ethereum PoS network is temporarily reported to be 488,686 ETH, which is approximately worth $17.85 billion. The amount of queued ETH has been continuously decreasing for 3 days, and the waiting time for exit is approximately 8 days and 12 hours.At the same time, the amount of ETH queued to join the network is approximately 125,718 ETH, worth approximately $4.59 billion, with an expected activation delay of about 2 days and 4 hours.Earlier reports have shown that this situation reflects two opposing forces in the market. On the one hand, some stakers may have decided to cash out after Ethereum rebounded by more than 160% from its April low, resulting in a surge in the exit queue. On the other hand, new inflows of funds, mainly driven by regulatory tailwinds and institutional demand, are also boosting the entry queue. This is evident in publicly traded companies s</description>

      <title>Chaos Labs: Aave&apos;s $4.7B Exposure to Ethena Could Trigger &quot;Liquidity Crunch&quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23179</link>
      <description>On August 5th, as reported by DL News, Chaos Labs, Aave&apos;s risk advisor, stated that with the continuous increase in the deposit amount of the US dollar-pegged token USDe in the protocol, Ethena&apos;s USDe stablecoin may pose a threat to Aave&apos;s robustness and trigger a liquidity crunch. In a post released on Saturday on the Aave governance forum, Chaos Labs discussed the potential risks of Aave&apos;s exposure to Ethena, which has been on the rise. Chaos Labs pointed out that when USDe holders deposit a large amount of the token into Aave and its issuer Ethena simultaneously lends out the stablecoin backing that asset, a significant risk is formed. Ethena must avoid overallocating its stablecoin reserves to Aave. Self-imposed limits on such exposure help ensure redemption reliability and market stability.

In addition, Aave&apos;</description>
