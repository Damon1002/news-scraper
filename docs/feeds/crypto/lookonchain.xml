      <title>Federal Reserve&apos;s Barkin: If the economy continues to perform well, interest rates are expected to be adjusted gradually</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26388</link>
      <description>On August 27th, Federal Reserve&apos;s Powell stated that, considering his expectation that economic activity will remain relatively stable for the rest of the year, interest rates will experience a moderate adjustment. He said, &quot;I perceive the economy operating in a moderate manner. If the economy operates moderately, it implies that interest rates will also adjust moderately.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m not certain whether the economy will truly develop in such a moderate way. We&apos;ll have to wait and observe. Therefore, this is my forecast, but forecasts are subject to change.&quot; Powell declined to provide details on the action he would be inclined to take in September. &quot;I&apos;m aware that there are three and a half weeks until the next meeting. On that day, based on all the available information, I will make the best judgment possible.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>Justin Sun: Meme Coin is the transformation of internet attention into money.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26387</link>
      <description>On August 27th, Justin Sun stated in a recent interview with The Late Point that meme coins are centered around transforming internet attention into money. For instance, issuing a Biden coin at present would not attract any buyers because Biden has not yet completed the transition from being the name of the U.S. president to an IP or a particular type of meme. There exists a substantial gap between coins that anyone can issue and having the issued token be recognized, and one must excel in the internet attention economy in order to become a winner.</description>
