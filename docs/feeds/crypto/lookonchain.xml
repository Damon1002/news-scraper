      <title>Traders currently estimate a 100% probability of the Fed cutting interest rates this month</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27891</link>
      <description>September 5th. Traders currently hold the view that there is a 100% likelihood of the Fed implementing an interest rate cut this month. There is a 12% chance that the rate cut will amount to 50 basis points. Prior to the release of the weak jobs report, the market had anticipated a rate cut, but not to this extent.Brian Jacobsen of Annex Wealth pointed out that the revised data showed &quot;virtually no new jobs being created,&quot; once again igniting discussions in the market regarding a more substantial rate cut. After the data was made public, the yields on U.S. short-term government bonds experienced a significant decline.</description>

      <title>The U.S. added a moderate number of non-farm jobs in August, with the unemployment rate rising to its highest level since 2021.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27888</link>
      <description>September 5th: The notable deceleration in US August employment growth led to the unemployment rate reaching its highest level since 2021, giving rise to concerns that the labor market might be experiencing a more severe deterioration.The report issued by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday demonstrated that nonfarm payrolls rose by 22,000 in August. Revised figures indicated a contraction in employment in June, which was the first decline in employment since 2020. Against the backdrop of the astonishing report in July, this data is likely to intensify concerns about the endurance of the job market.In recent months, employment growth has slowed down significantly, job vacancies have dwindled, and wage growth has moderated, all of which are exerting pressure on broader economic activities. Traders keep wagering that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates during its September meeting. Policymakers will also receive the latest CPI report prior to the meeting.
