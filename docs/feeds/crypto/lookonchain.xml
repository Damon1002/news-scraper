      <title>Analysis: At the current price, Bitmine would need to invest approximately $19 billion more to reach the &quot;5% Ethereum supply&quot; goal.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/26623</link>
      <description>On August 28th, according to CryptoISO, Bitmine is currently reported to be holding more than 1.7 million ETH. In order to reach a reserve target of 5% of Ethereum&apos;s supply, approximately an additional 4.3 million ETH would need to be purchased.At the current price ($4534), this transaction would demand an investment of around $19.5 billion. When the ETH price is close to $4200, this cost will be reduced to approximately $18.2 billion. The estimated daily trading volume of ETH is between $30 billion and $50 billion.An analysis indicates that compared to Michael Saylor, who often makes large purchases of $500 million to $1 billion, each time causing the Bitcoin price to immediately rise by more than 2%, Tom Lee is evidently more experienced. Nevertheless, this also means that after the low point of $4060, ETH is most likely to have an &quot;invisible floor&quot; within the range of $4200 to $4400.</description>
