      <title>Trump&apos;s Tariffs Impact Economy, U.S. Wholesale Prices Soar</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24617</link>
      <description>August 14th: In the United States, wholesale prices witnessed a significant surge in July, with a year-on-year increase of 3.3%. This represents the most prominent indication thus far that President Trump&apos;s tariff policy is having an impact on the U.S. economy. The Producer Price Index (PPI) recorded its largest growth since February of this year. This index measures the prices that domestic producers receive for their goods and services. The data far exceeded the 2.4% year-on-year increase in June and the anticipated 2.5% increase projected by surveyed economists. After the release of the PPI report, both the two-year U.S. Treasury bond yield and the U.S. dollar, which are sensitive to interest rate expectations, showed an upward trend. (FX168)</description>

      <title>Bernoth: Not Urging Fed Rate Cut, Just Citing Model Result</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24614</link>
      <description>On August 14th, US Treasury Secretary Yellen stated that he is not demanding a series of interest rate cuts from the Fed. He merely pointed out that his model indicates that the &quot;neutral&quot; interest rate will be approximately 1.5 percentage points lower than it is currently. Yellen said: &quot;I did not tell the Fed what to do.&quot; He was referring to his remarks the previous day regarding the Fed &quot;being capable of initiating a series of rate cuts.&quot;Yellen stated on Thursday: &quot;What I said is that in order to reach the neutral rate, it would necessitate a rate cut of about 150 basis points. If you believe in the existence of the neutral rate, I think there is room for a series of rate cuts. However, I am not calling for a rate cut. I do not make such a call. I merely stated that the model calculates the neutral rate to be approximately 150 basis points lower than the current level.&quot; (FXStreet)</description>
