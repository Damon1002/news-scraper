      <title>JPMorgan: Initial Jobless Claims Data Does Not Show Rapid Deterioration in Labor Market</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25600</link>
      <description>August 21st - Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies, wrote in a report that the initial claims data did not suggest a rapid deterioration in the labor market. &quot;The sideways fluctuations in both initial and continuing claims in recent months imply that layoff activities remain restricted. The &apos;no hiring/no firing&apos; characteristic of the labor market continues to be firmly in effect.&quot; The most recent jobless claims data pertain to the reference week for the August nonfarm payroll report, which will be released in early September. Simons pointed out that since the reference week in July, initial claims have increased by 14,000, while the four-week moving average has decreased by approximately 5,000. (FXStreet)</description>

      <title>Analyst: Trump Policy Could Weaken Dollar&apos;s Cyclical Support</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25592</link>
      <description>On August 21st, Jill Hirzel from Insight Investment declared in a report that the US dollar might weaken. This is because Trump&apos;s policies have diminished the allure of US exceptionalism and could result in a reduction of capital inflows into the US. Hirzel said, &quot;Policy uncertainty and a more assertive &apos;America First&apos; agenda may eat away at the cyclical support for the US dollar, causing it to enter a prolonged period of weakness.&quot; Nevertheless, she also noted that investors should be cautious when overly betting on the dollar&apos;s decline through short positions. This is because growth outside the US is expected to be at best lackluster, and speculators may already have significant short positions on the dollar. Additionally, before there are signs of economic weakness that are sufficient to worry policymakers, real interest rates adjusted for inflation may still remain high. (FXStreet)</description>
