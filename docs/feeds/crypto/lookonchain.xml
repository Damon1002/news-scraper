      <title>If Bitcoin breaks $119,000, the mainstream CEX aggregate short liquidation pressure will reach $948 million.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21927</link>
      <description>On July 26th, based on Coinglass data, if Bitcoin surges above $119,000, the total short liquidation strength on mainstream CEXs will amount to $948 million. In contrast, if Bitcoin drops below $116,000, the total long liquidation strength on mainstream CEXs will reach $588 million.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the precise value of the contracts to be liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to adjacent liquidation clusters, that is, strength.Consequently, the liquidation chart shows the extent to which the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price, when reached, will have a more pronounced reaction due to a liquidity avalanche.</description>
