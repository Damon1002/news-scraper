      <title>SlowMist Cosmos Update on Venus Security Incident: Compromised Whale Account Targeted with a Spear Phishing Attack, Related Wallet Extension Replaced</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27347</link>
      <description>On September 2nd, SlowMist Cosmos updated the Venus security incident on the X platform in the following manner: In this whale theft incident, both the Venus protocol and the front end are supposed to be in good condition. Currently, the joint partner analysis by SlowMist tends to believe that the whale was the target of a pinpoint attack. Although the whale used a hardware wallet, the relevant wallet extension on the computer (used in combination with the hardware wallet) was replaced. When the user issued a normal redeemUnderlying operation, it was replaced with an updateDelegate operation, ultimately leading to the theft of assets in their Venus.The hacker targeted the funds of this whale through a pinpoint attack. The Gas came from the privacy token Monero XMR exchange, and other related funds traced back to eXch, which is the previously sanctioned dark web trading platform and also a platform that was favored by North Korean hackers in the past.</description>
