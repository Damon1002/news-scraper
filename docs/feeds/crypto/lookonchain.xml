      <title>Musk: AI5 will be an epic-level chip, and AI6 is expected to be the best AI chip to date</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27984</link>
      <description>September 7th, Musk stated in a post that &quot;Today witnessed an excellent AI5 chip design review with the Tesla AI chip team. AI5 is a remarkable one, and AI6 has the potential to be the best AI chip to date. Shifting from two to a single architecture implies that all Tesla AI chip talents will concentrate on one outstanding chip. I believe that AI5 could be the best for all inference chips for models with around 250B params or less, offering the lowest silicon cost to date and the highest performance per watt. AI6 will be even more superior.&quot;</description>
