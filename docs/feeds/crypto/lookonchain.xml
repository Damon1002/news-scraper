      <title>Analyst: ETH Outperforms on Strong Treasury Holdings, Sustainability of High Inflows Questioned</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27627</link>
      <description>On September 4th, according to The Block, Presto research analyst Min Jung stated that the market&apos;s buying pressure is mainly sustained by the continuous accumulation of Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies. He attributed Ethereum&apos;s significant surge on Wednesday to this trend.Jung said, &quot;ETH performed well again, likely due to the same fund inflow driven by DAT. However, we remain cautious about the sustainability of this theme and the ability of DAT companies to maintain high purchase volumes.&quot;The analyst also previously pointed out that funds are continuously rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum as traders believe that after Bitcoin hit historic highs in July and August, Ethereum offered more profit-taking opportunities.</description>

      <title>Ukrainian Parliament Passes First Reading of Cryptocurrency Legalization and Taxation Bill</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27626</link>
      <description>On September 4th, according to a report by Cointelegraph, Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak disclosed that the Ukrainian parliament passed the first reading of a cryptocurrency legalization and taxation bill on Wednesday. Once the bill is ultimately signed into law, it will exert a significant influence on Ukraine&apos;s digital asset economy.In the first reading vote, the bill received the support of 246 MPs. The draft bill stipulates that digital asset profits will be subject to an 18% income tax and a 5% military tax. The announcement also noted that the bill sets a 5% preferential tax rate for fiat-crypto exchanges in the first year.The proposed 23% tax rate is in line with the recommendations of the Ukrainian financial regulator in April. The initial proposal included exemptions for cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency transactions and stablecoin transactions, which makes Ukraine&apos;s crypto tax regime more similar to that of crypto-friendly countries.</description>
