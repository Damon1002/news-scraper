      <title>Gemini Co-founder Accuses JPMorgan of Blocking Gemini Due to Its Public Criticism</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21940</link>
      <description>On July 26th, Tyler Winklevoss, a co-founder of Gemini, accused JPMorgan of suspending the reconnection process to its cryptocurrency exchange Gemini because of his public criticism of the bank&apos;s latest data access policy. Winklevoss posted on X on Friday and stated that JPMorgan took retaliatory action after he pointed out that the bank&apos;s new policy showed anti-competitive behavior and could harm the fintech and crypto industry.“My tweet last week hit them where it matters. This week, JPMorgan informed us that due to that tweet, they have decided to suspend the reconnection process to Gemini. Previously, they had removed us in &apos;Operation ChokePoint 2.0&apos;,” Winklevoss wrote. The controversy arose from a recent Bloomberg report which revealed JPMorgan&apos;s decision to charge fintech firms for accessing customer bank data. Winklevoss believes this move will “bankrupt fintech firms supporting crypto purchases.”Winklevoss accused JPMorgan of trying to restrict consumers&apos; free access to the</description>

      <title>LIBRA Project Advisor Acknowledges LIBRA as a Speculative Meme Coin</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/21939</link>
      <description>On July 26th, as per Argentine media Clarín, Hayden Davis, an advisor to the LIBRA project, recently submitted a document to a U.S. court. For the first time, he acknowledged that LIBRA is a Meme token and denied that it is an investment project with a business plan. This contradicts the claim made by President Javier Milei that it &quot;supports the Argentine economy.&quot;Davis&apos;s defense attorney admitted that the Meme token &quot;is not an investment, has no intrinsic value, but is an unsecured and uncollateralized asset with speculative and collectible characteristics, and its market volatility is extremely high.&quot; Meanwhile, another fund transaction came to light. On January 30th of this year, during a meeting at the presidential palace with Milei, the wallet associated with Davis transferred nearly 500,000 USDC to the centralized exchange Kraken, suspected to be related to project fund flows. Records also show that the purpose of the meeting held at the presidential palace on January 30th was</description>
