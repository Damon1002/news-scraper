      <title>South Korea Issues Warning on Cryptocurrency Loan and Margin Trading Services by Upbit and Bithumb</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22638</link>
      <description>On July 31st, as per Decrypt&apos;s report, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) of South Korea expressed their concerns last Friday regarding Upbit and Bithumb&apos;s launch of leverage up to 4 times on lending products, enabling short selling through borrowed funds. Upbit has already ceased its USDT lending service. Meanwhile, Bithumb adjusted its structure on Tuesday but still maintained the controversial 4x leverage ratio. South Korean crypto experts caution that stricter regulations may lead users to offshore platforms with weaker compliance standards, thereby weakening South Korea&apos;s investor protection and its capacity to shape its cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <title>Chicago Mercantile Exchange proposed simplifying the listing process for cryptocurrency ETFs</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22634</link>
      <description>On July 31st, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) put forward a new proposal. It suggests that a crypto ETF meeting standardization requirements can bypass the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&apos;s case-by-case approval process and achieve automatic listing. The proposal indicates that if a crypto asset has been trading on a regulated market for futures for more than 6 months, the relevant ETF can be eligible for listing. Additionally, the proposal sets requirements for physically-backed ETFs. It states that a liquidity risk management plan must be established when more than 15% of ETF assets cannot be redeemed immediately.</description>
