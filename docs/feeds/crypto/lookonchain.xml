      <title>Several KOLs have revealed that the team member of Kaito, Wen Yue, is suspected of receiving a bribe. Wen Yue has denied the accusation, stating that all payments were made directly to Kaito.</title>

      <description>July 30th. Recently, several KOLs, like CryptoBrave (@cryptobraveHQ), have claimed that Kaito&apos;s Business Manager WenYue is suspected of taking bribes.Among them, CryptoBrave said that WenYue imposed an excessive listing fee on certain projects, overcharging approximately $200,000 in suspected bribes in the name of an overall fee package to ensure the project&apos;s priority listing on Kaito. The crypto influencer @SEFATUBA3 stated, &quot;WenYue demands a $30,000 bridge toll, which can be paid through white list allocation or tokens.&quot;In response to the above accusations, WenYue (@0xWenMoon) said, &quot;I have never accepted any bribes. Any payment exceeding $150,000 was for additional professional analysis services (such as the Kaito Pro platform) or to accelerate the listing schedule (for example, if the project team needed to quickly climb the rankings to align with a specific event). All payments are made directly to Kaito and not to me or any other individual.&quot;</description>
