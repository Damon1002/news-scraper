      <title>Analyst: Data shows that options traders continue to remain optimistic, with the majority believing that the trend is not over yet</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25332</link>
      <description>August 20th. On-chain data analyst Murphy posted on social media, indicating that based on the &quot;Option Strike Heatmap&quot; data, on August 19th, there was a large-scale call option activity in the price range of $123,708 to $129,685. The total option premium size was approximately $43.32 million. At the same time, there was no net buying below the spot price, suggesting that traders were more inclined to bet on BTC rising to this range and there was little demand for put options, with almost no one actively purchasing downside protection.On the other hand, relatively larger-scale put options were sold in the price range of $97,709 to $102,430, and the total option premium size was approximately $13.14 million. This indicates that option sellers think it is unlikely for the price to drop to this level and choose to sell volatility.Therefore, the sentiment among option market traders remains optimistic. Most still believe that BTC&apos;s trend is not over and are betting that it can return to</description>

      <title>Matrixport: Current Crypto Concept Stock Institutional Participation is Insufficient, Stock Price May Further Consolidate in the Short Term</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25330</link>
      <description>On August 20th, Matrixport released a new report on social media. It stated that following a strong 18-month rally, crypto concept stocks have entered a consolidation phase. During the past 18 months, the crypto concept stock index has outperformed Bitcoin significantly. However, with the recent pullbacks in the stock prices of leading companies like MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and Metaplanet, the index has started to show signs of a correction. The cooling of buying interest after Circle&apos;s listing further confirms the lack of momentum in the new stock market.Analyst Markus Thielen said that the current low institutional participation may reflect the seasonal weakness in summer. Without the support of major crypto IPOs, prices may further consolidate in the short term.</description>

      <title>Analyst: Bitcoin Support Located in $109,600 to $106,800 High Demand Zone</title>

The mid-term support is at the 111-day moving average ($109,600), and the short-term holder realized price is ($106,800). This area forms a dense area of demand, and it is anticipated that there will be attempts at stabilization and a rebound in this zone.</description>

      <title>Analysis: The U.S. Treasury is set to withdraw $500-600 billion in cash from the market over the next two months, potentially leading to increased market illiquidity.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25326</link>
      <description>August 20th. The Delphi Digital Market Research Institute put out an article indicating that in the forthcoming weeks, the US Treasury Department will commence replenishing its General Account (TGA). This process will withdraw $500–600 billion in cash from the market over approximately two months. On the surface, this might seem ordinary. However, the current period is evolving into one of the most fragile liquidity environments of the past decade.In 2023, the $550 billion TGA replenishment was cushioned by more than $2 trillion of Fed reverse repo tools, healthy bank reserves, and strong overseas bond demand. Now, these cushions have disappeared. The Fed is still consuming liquidity through Quantitative Tightening (QT). Reverse repos are almost depleted. Banks are restricted by losses and capital rules. Overseas buyers from China to Japan have also withdrawn. As a result, every dollar raised by the Treasury Department this fall will be directly drawn from active market liquidity.H</description>

      <title>Institution: Powell to Open Door to September Rate Cut at Jackson Hole</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25324</link>
      <description>On August 20th, MainSky Asset Management Company declared that Federal Reserve Chairman Powell is likely to open the door to a rate cut in September during the upcoming Jackson Hole Symposium. The chairman of the MainSky Board, Eckhard Schulte, stated that, in contrast to last year&apos;s meeting when Powell prepared the market for a 50-basis-point rate cut, this time the cut is anticipated to be only 25 basis points. He pointed out: &quot;Unlike last year, the current monetary policy is closer to the &apos;neutral rate,&apos; thus there is no requirement for a rapid and significant rate hike to achieve normalization.&quot; MainSky anticipates that there will be at least one more rate cut in the fourth quarter of this year.
