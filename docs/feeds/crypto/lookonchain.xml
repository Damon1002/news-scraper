      <title>Nvidia Denies H100/H200 Chip Shortage Rumors: Ample Inventory to Instantly Meet Order Demand</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27413</link>
      <description>September 3rd, Nvidia (NVDA.O) declared that the recent media reports regarding the &quot;limited supply&quot; and &quot;sold out&quot; rumors about Nvidia&apos;s H100/H200 chips are all inaccurate. As detailed in the financial report, while cloud service partners are indeed capable of leasing all of their H100/H200 chips online, this does not imply that Nvidia is unable to accept new orders. With an ample stock of H100/H200, they can promptly fulfill all order requirements. Rumors suggesting that the H20 chip is cutting into the supply of H100/H200 or Blackwell products are also entirely unfounded—sales of the H20 chip will never have an impact on Nvidia&apos;s supply capabilities for other products.

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27410</link>
      <description>On September 3rd, Joseph Chalom, the Co-CEO of SharpLink which is the second-largest treasury company in Ethereum, published an article to explain why ETH is favored by Wall Street capital. He stated that Ethereum is the place where capital wants to go. With 10 years of continuous operation, it ensures the storage of trillions of dollars in value. At the same time, the new foundation leadership is making significant progress at the L1 level. Therefore, SharpLink is very optimistic about the entire Ethereum ecosystem, including L1 and L2, believing that it will attract capital attention. Since Ethereum on-chain transactions are secure and ongoing, SharpLink believes that ETH is a high-quality treasury asset - the world&apos;s first truly trusted commodity with productivity, profitability, programmability and is rapidly becoming a core institutional digital asset.</description>
