      <title>Trader Eugene: Once again reducing a significant portion of long positions, the current alt season&apos;s wealth effect may be the weakest in history</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22439</link>
      <description>On July 30th, trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio posted on his personal channel, saying, &quot;I have once more cut down the majority of my long positions and am still maintaining a defensive stance. Historically, August usually presents challenges, and I don&apos;t think this year will be smooth sailing.&quot;Interestingly, in terms of the wealth effect resulting from the increase in the price of Ethereum, this round of the altcoin season may be the weakest. This once again indicates that institutional funds are the main force driving the buying pressure, and the funds have not flowed back into altcoins (which also reconfirms my previous stance of only holding ETH).&quot;</description>

      <title>Binance: Users holding at least 200 Alpha tokens are eligible to claim an airdrop of 1000 RHEA tokens</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22438</link>
      <description>On July 30th, as per official information, Binance is the first exchange to list Rhea Finance (RHEA), and trading will commence on July 30, 2025, at 21:30 (UTC+8). After the start of trading, users who hold at least 200 Alpha points can claim a 1000 RHEA token airdrop. The first come, first served principle applies. If the event is not yet completed, the points threshold will automatically decrease by 15 points every hour. Claiming the airdrop will consume 15 Alpha points. Users must confirm the claim on the Alpha event page within 24 hours; otherwise, it will be regarded as a waiver of the airdrop.</description>

      <title>Matrixport: The current sentiment is diverging from the fundamentals, which may signal a cooling-off period in the market in the short term</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22435</link>
      <description>On July 30th, Matrixport released today&apos;s market analysis which stated, &quot;The current Greed and Fear Index is approaching a high level, and the slow moving average is also showing signs of a top signal. Looking back at history, whenever this indicator is in an upward phase, the Bitcoin price usually demonstrates strength; however, once it begins to decline, it often indicates a cooling-off of market sentiment, and investors need to be more cautious.&quot;&quot;In early July, we made a bullish judgment that went against the mainstream view. But as the market developed, we have also shifted to a more cautious stance, expecting Bitcoin to enter a consolidation phase in August. The latest trend of the Greed and Fear Index also validates this assessment: despite the continuous positive news, market momentum has weakened.&quot;&quot;The current divergence between sentiment and fundamentals may suggest that the market could enter a cooling-off phase in the short term. It is recommended that investors closely</description>
