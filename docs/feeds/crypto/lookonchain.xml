      <title>Binance Partners with Spanish Bank BBVA to Allow Customers to Hold Assets Off the Crypto Exchange Platform</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23649</link>
      <description>On August 8th, as reported by the Financial Times, Binance is collaborating with the Spanish bank BBVA. This enables customers to have their assets custodied by the bank rather than the exchange. BBVA, Spain&apos;s third-largest bank, has recently begun serving as one of the few independent custodians for Binance. The purpose of this move is to address investors&apos; concerns regarding the security of the exchange, particularly in the aftermath of the 2022 FTX bankruptcy event. Under the cooperative arrangement, traders&apos; funds will be held in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds at BBVA, and Binance will accept these assets as trading margin.</description>

      <title>If Ethereum Breaks $4000, Mainstream CEX Cumulative Short Liquidation Pressure Will Reach $677 Million</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23647</link>
      <description>On August 8th, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum breaks through $4000, the cumulative short liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX will amount to 677 million.Conversely, if Ethereum drops below $3800, the cumulative long liquidation intensity of mainstream CEX will reach 1.247 billion.BlockBeats Notes: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the precise value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the relative significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring liquidation clusters, which is referred to as intensity.Consequently, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the price of the underlying asset will be influenced when it reaches a particular level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that the price will undergo a more pronounced reaction due to a liquidity cascade when it reaches that specific point.</description>

      <title>Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s has assigned Sky Protocol a &apos;B-&apos; credit rating due to its &quot;centralization and liquidity risks.&quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/23644</link>
      <description>On August 8th, as per The Block, S&amp;P Global has granted a &quot;B-&quot; credit rating to the issuer of USDS, Sky Protocol. This marks the first time that a rating agency has issued a credit rating for a stablecoin system. The report indicates that although Sky has maintained stable profits since 2020 and the losses have been manageable during market volatility, there are three main risks. Firstly, the founder Rune Christensen actually controls protocol decisions through a 9% governance token (and the low voting turnout exacerbates centralization). Secondly, the concentration of large depositors may trigger a bank run. Thirdly, there is a 0.4% risk-adjusted capital ratio and a weak static surplus reserve mechanism.S&amp;P states that the network security risks brought by smart contract asset storage and the uncertainty of DeFi regulations pose potential threats. In the next 12 months, if Sky experiences liquidity shortages, excessive losses in crypto loans, or an unfavorable regulatory environment</description>
