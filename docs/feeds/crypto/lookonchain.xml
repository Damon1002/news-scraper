      <title>NAVI Team Carl: The average survival period of an AI Content Token is 5 to 6 months, and its ultimate survival depends on actual use case.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22685</link>
      <description>On July 31st, Carl, the business director of NAVI Protocol, who was a guest on BlockBeats&apos; &quot;Content Coin: Hype, Hope, or the Second Spring of Creator Economy?&quot; themed Space, stated that from 2023 to 2024, the average lifespan of all AI concept projects is only approximately 5 to 6 months. AI content tokens are prone to being hyped, but in order to survive in the long term, they need to be provided with a use case. The question of whether AI content has value ultimately depends on how to add more functionality to the AI token itself, and real-world use cases are a way out for AI content tokens.Ongoing Space: https://x.com/i/spaces/1vAxRDOWWqkGl</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrency and AI Researcher Wang Chao: Content Tokens should be explored, but the success rate of highly speculative tokens is questionable</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22682</link>
      <description>July 31st, Cryptocurrency and AI researcher Wang Chao, as a guest on BlockBeats&apos; &quot;Content Coin: Hype, Hope, or Second Spring of Creator Economy?&quot; themed Space, expressed his viewpoints. He stated that some AI-generated content is undoubtedly valuable. Nevertheless, the value of packaging AI-generated content into tokens remains questionable and depends on whether the generated content is valuable. All data itself has asset attributes, but this value is difficult to measure within the traditional price system. It is not denied that content tokens should be explored, and some content tokens are valuable. However, there is a strong doubt regarding the probability of success for a highly speculative token.Ongoing Space: https://x.com/i/spaces/1vAxRDOWWqkGl</description>

      <title>Liu Feng: Pump.Fun is no longer just a Meme issuance platform; Meme creation is also a form of content creation.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22677</link>
      <description>On July 31st, Liu Feng, a partner at BODL Ventures, as a guest on BlockBeats&apos; themed Space titled &quot;Content Coin: Hype, Hope, or the Second Spring of the Creator Economy?&quot;, stated that he did not clearly sense the distinct boundary between Meme coins and content coins. Today, Pump.Fun is no longer merely a Meme issuance platform. Many people have a fondness for it, and those who love Pump.Fun will bestow upon it countless different stories and interpretations. A more prevalent interpretation is that Pump.Fun is actually a live streaming platform, a news platform, and more significantly, a platform for creating socially trending content. This kind of meme token that motivates everyone to create is actually a type of content coin.Space in progress: https://x.com/i/spaces/1vAxRDOWWqkGl</description>
