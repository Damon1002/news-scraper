      <title>The Strategy&apos;s profitability level has met the S&amp;P 500 inclusion criteria. If included, it will bring in $16 billion in liquidity.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27838</link>
      <description>On September 5th, according to Bloomberg, with regard to Strategy, as it recorded $14 billion in unrealized gains in the last quarter, it has theoretically met the profitability requirement for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500. If included, passive funds tracking the index would be required to passively purchase around 50 million shares, which would amount to approximately $16 billion at the current price. This would lead institutional passive holders to hold around $70 billion of its Bitcoin reserves.Although Strategy had already been included in the Nasdaq 100 by the end of 2024, the S&amp;P 500 has more stringent requirements regarding liquidity, market capitalization (no less than $227 billion), earnings history, and industry balance. The final decision still depends on the committee&apos;s judgment.</description>

      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/27836</link>
      <description>September 5th. According to the Hong Kong Economic Times, Liu Jing, the Chief Economist of HSBC Global Asset Management in the Greater China region, stated in his speech at the Lujiazui Forum in June that PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng mentioned the establishment of an international operation center for the digital RMB. Meanwhile, some large central enterprises are actively exploring the applications of stablecoins. When Chinese enterprises invest in Belt and Road emerging markets, they often face issues such as local currency volatility and a lack of hedging tools. In such cases, these enterprises may explore issuing their own RMB stablecoins to assist in investing in emerging markets.Liu Jing pointed out that when multiple Chinese enterprises issue RMB stablecoins, the digital RMB may serve as an intermediary connecting various RMB stablecoins, which will contribute to the expansion of the international usage of the RMB.She further stated that Hong Kong, considering its cooperation</description>
