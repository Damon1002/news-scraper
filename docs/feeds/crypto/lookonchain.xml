      <title>SharpLink Board Chairman: Actively Considering Convertible Note Financing to Stabilize Stock Price</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22769</link>
      <description>On August 1st, Joseph Lubin, the Chairman of the Board of SharpLink and the CEO and Founder of ConsenSys, stated in an interview that SharpLink has been conducting At-The-Market (ATM) sales of its stock, which has led to the dilution of the equity of SBET investors. This has triggered panic and concerns, causing the stock price to plummet from $37 to below $20 within less than two weeks.The issuance of convertible notes by SharpLink means that they will be able to raise funds without immediately diluting equity (convertible bonds carry debt risks and may result in future dilution upon conversion), but in the short term, this may stabilize SBET (by reducing the stock entering the market).</description>

      <title>Analysis: Bitcoin &apos;Filling the Gap&apos; Probability is Rising, Pullback Bottom or Forming in &apos;Double Anchor Structure&apos; Middle</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22767</link>
      <description>On August 1st, the on-chain data analyst Murphy stated in a post that the $117,000 Bitcoin support level has been broken through, and the probability of a &quot;gap fill&quot; is on the rise. According to Bitcoin on-chain data, the $117,000 price level is a bar with a significantly higher volume compared to other price ranges in the URPD chip structure. A total of 720,000 BTC are stacked at this single price, indicating an intense battle between bulls and bears at the $117,000 price level, resulting in significant turnover. The current price of BTC has already dropped below this key support level.Whenever a single price bar accumulates more chips, the game will reach a critical point, and the market will face a moment of short-term directional choice. The chip range from $116,000 to $119,000 has high density but lacks width, making it vulnerable to a short-term breakthrough. Currently, the market seems to be choosing a downward direction and entering the middle area of the chip ranges from $11</description>
