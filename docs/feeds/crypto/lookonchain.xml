      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/28023</link>

It currently stands at 698,120 ETH, which is approximately worth $3 billion. The estimated exit waiting time is about 12 days and 3 hours.At the same time, there are approximately 860,782 ETH in the queue waiting to join the network, with a value of around $3.7 billion.

Meanwhile, reports indicated that his family&apos;s cryptocurrency business was alleged to have accumulated billions of dollars. Warren said in the video: &quot;What astonishes everyone is that Trump is actually a major con artist. The prices of food, gasoline, school supplies, and strollers are all on the rise. Trump has let down ordinary working families. He did not lower grocery prices. Instead, he played a &apos;red light, green light&apos; game with tariffs, actually increasing people&apos;s shopping expenses.&quot;Warren specifically pointed out that the Trump family&apos;s holdings in the WLFI token had increased significantly in value, bringing them an estimated $5 billion in paper wealth growth.
