      <title>If Ethereum Breaks All-Time High, Mainstream CEX Cumulative Short Liquidation Pressure Will Reach $1.199 Billion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24405</link>
      <description>On August 13th, according to Coinglass data, if Ethereum were to break its all-time high, the total short liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs would reach $1.199 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum were to drop below $4550, the total long liquidation intensity on mainstream CEXs would reach $2.128 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not display the exact number of contracts awaiting liquidation or the exact value of contracts being liquidated. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to neighboring clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows to what degree the target price will be influenced when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price is reached, there will be a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>

      <title>FOMC: Federal Reserve&apos;s September Rate Cut Expectation Boosts Ethereum&apos;s Momentum, Jackson Hole Symposium Next Focus</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24404</link>
      <description>August 13th: QCP issued its daily market observation, indicating that the US July CPI (Consumer Price Index) rose by 2.7% year-on-year, which was lower than the market&apos;s anticipation of 2.8%; the core CPI increased by 3.1% year-on-year, slightly higher than the expected 3.0%. The relatively moderate overall inflation data has reinforced the market&apos;s expectation that the Fed will initiate a rate-cutting cycle in September.
