      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25649</link>
      <description>On August 22nd, according to data from Coinglass, if Ethereum manages to break through $4400, the total intensity of short liquidation on mainstream CEX will reach $2.072 billion.Conversely, if Ethereum drops below $4000, the total intensity of long liquidation on mainstream CEX will reach $1.202 billion.BlockBeats Note: The liquidation chart does not provide the exact number of contracts to be liquidated or the exact value of the liquidated contracts. The bars on the liquidation chart actually represent the significance of each liquidation cluster in relation to nearby liquidation clusters, that is, intensity.Therefore, the liquidation chart shows the extent to which the price of the underlying asset will be impacted when it reaches a certain level. A higher &quot;liquidation bar&quot; indicates that when the price reaches that level, it will experience a more intense reaction due to a liquidity cascade.</description>
