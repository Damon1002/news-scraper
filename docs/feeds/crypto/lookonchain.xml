      <title>Analysis: Bitcoin May Experience a Deeper Pullback if It Falls Below Short-Term Holder Cost of $106,000</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25540</link>
      <description>On August 21st, CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. put forward that Bitcoin is continuously withdrawing from its all-time high. The one-year MVRV Z-Score has declined to nearly neutral, currently being slightly below zero. This indicates that the unrealized profits on the network are somewhat compressed compared to the one-year average level, with a greater amount of supply at the breakeven point or in a loss-making state.The key support level of Bitcoin is at the short-term holder realized price of $106,000. If the price falls below $106,000, short-term holders will be in an overall loss, and the market will be at the risk of a more significant pullback.The recovery signal would be when the Z-Score continues to rise above zero and the price regains $118,000.</description>
