      <title>Hong Kong Legislator: Stablecoins Have No Pump-and-Dump Opportunity, Regulations Reference Industry Practices in the US, Japan, and EU</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/22962</link>
      <description>August 3rd. Ted Hui, a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, stated in an interview that the core characteristic of a fiat-backed stablecoin is that it must be backed by highly liquid fiat reserves at a rate of 100%. Currently, the main function of a fiat-backed stablecoin is still international payments, and there is no chance for speculation.During the formulation of the &quot;Stablecoin Regulations&quot;, references were made to the United States, Japan, and the EU&apos;s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation, as well as Singapore&apos;s Payment Service Act (PSA). The legislation takes into account international circulation and demand and adheres to both international and national standards. Additionally, Hui also mentioned that Hong Kong&apos;s stablecoin should not compete for market share with existing products but should explore new markets. (Daily Economic News)</description>
