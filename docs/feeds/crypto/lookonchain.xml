      <title>Helius is launching a new feature where transactions can earn SOL rewards.</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24912</link>
      <description>On August 17th, as per official channels, Helius has made an official announcement regarding the launch of a new feature. Under this feature, users will be able to obtain SOL rewards while conducting transactions. The purpose of this mechanism is to assist users in reaping the profits that were previously obtained by arbitrageurs, thereby making transactions more efficient and rewarding.Specifically, when users complete a transaction (such as buying/selling/exchanging), if the transaction triggers an arbitrage opportunity (for instance, a price update on different trading platforms), the user will receive a 50% reward. The entire transaction process will not have an impact on the execution of the transaction itself, and there is no malicious MEV risk. This model is referred to as &quot;productive MEV&quot; because it can facilitate the timely update of prices and enhance market efficiency.This feature is completely optional for participation and will only be activated when users choose to op</description>

      <title>BTCS CEO: Frequent Public Disclosure of Crypto Holdings Not Necessarily in Shareholders&apos; Best Interests</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/24910</link>
      <description>On August 17th, Charles Allen, the CEO of the Ethereum strategic reserve company BTCS, mentioned that although the cryptocurrency field attaches great importance to real-time transparency, U.S. listed companies adhere to a quarterly disclosure rhythm. For major events, they are required to disclose within 4 days, which is the current stipulation.U.S. listed companies are naturally able to choose to disclose information more frequently as long as they refrain from involving GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) metrics that demand auditor review.However, more frequent disclosure is not always beneficial to shareholders. The board has a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of shareholders. After all, revealing all one&apos;s cards on the table is not the winning approach in the game.</description>
