      <title>Coinbase Research Director: Predicts Stablecoin Market Size Could Reach $1.2 Trillion by 2028</title>
      <link>https://www.lookonchain.com/feeds/25625</link>
      <description>On August 21st, David Duong, the Research Director of Coinbase, wrote that Coinbase Research employed a random model and the Monte Carlo simulation method to predict that the stablecoin market could reach $1.2 trillion by 2028. Future growth projections generally rely on assumptions regarding the share of the global money supply that stablecoins could ultimately hold. The model captures the potential growth range of the market through an autoregressive model AR(1), commencing from the most recent observed level and month-on-month growth, and simulates 20,000 Monte Carlo paths on a monthly basis in accordance with a simple AR(1) process. The predicted outcomes indicate that by December 2028, the stablecoin market could reach $1.2 trillion.</description>
