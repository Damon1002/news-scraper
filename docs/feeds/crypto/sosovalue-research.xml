      <title>Kled AI founder and Believe founder accuse each other, escalating the conflictBelieve ecosystem project Kled AI founder Avi Patel has expressed disappointment with the current handling of the Believe ecosystem, claiming a complete lack of support and communication. Believe founder Ben Pasternak accuses Avi of being a founder lacking integrity, alleging that Avi secretly sold $500,000.00 worth of KLED and lied that the sale was at Ben&apos;s direction. However, it is worth noting that yesterday, the official Believe Twitter account praised Kled for becoming a major data platform on Solana in just three months. [Wu Blockchain]</title>

      <title>Institutions: The US economy has not declined as expected, and AI may be the main contributorAccording to foreign media analysis reports, for the second time in three years, concerns about a US economic recession have once again been refuted by reality. This time, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may be the main contributor. As generative AI enters its third year, its financial impact is no longer limited to the stock prices of chip manufacturers. The surge in data center construction and overall capital expenditure is &quot;beautifying&quot; US GDP data in a surprising way. Carlyle Group&apos;s chief investment strategist Jason Thomas pointed out that this capital expenditure is an effective reindustrialization of American companies, shifting their focus from software and intangible assets to factories, machinery, and energy investments, which is unprecedented. This has a huge impact on GDP. Thomas estimates that AI-related spending alone may have contributed one-third of the US GDP growth in the second quarter of this year. And orders in related industries are still expanding at an annual growth rate of more than 40%. [Odaily News]</title>

      <title>DogeOS proposes to enable ZKP native verification capabilities on the Dogecoin network by introducing new opcodesOn July 23, according to CoinDesk, Dogecoin&apos;s ecological application development layer DogeOS officially submitted a technical proposal to Dogecoin Core, intending to implement zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) native verification function through a new opcode (OP_CHECKZKP). The upgrade will support off-chain applications such as Rollup and smart contracts, while maintaining the lightweight and high-speed characteristics of the main chain. The proposal adopts a modular design, and the first version supports Groth16 proof verification, and old version nodes can be compatible. To avoid performance risks, it is initially set that only one zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used for each script and only five zero-knowledge proofs can be used for each block. DogeOS simultaneously develops a zk virtual machine compatible with EVM, allowing Ethereum native applications to run directly on Dogecoin infrastructure. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Merlin Founder: 2.0 Upgrade Officially Released, Aiming to Create &quot;Yield-Generating and Tradable&quot; BTCIn an exclusive interview with Odaily, Jeff, the founder of the Bitcoin Layer2 project Merlin Chain, stated that the Merlin 2.0 upgrade plan has been officially released. This version will focus on &quot;BTC&apos;s yield-generating and cross-chain trading capabilities,&quot; aiming to upgrade Bitcoin from a single store-of-value asset to an on-chain currency with profitability and liquidity. Jeff pointed out that Merlin Chain&apos;s core goals in the future will revolve around two directions: first, to enhance the practicality of BTC, making it available for multi-chain interaction, DeFi investment, and asset trading; and second, to lower the barriers for retail and institutional investors to enter the BTC ecosystem, so that BTC can not only outperform the market but also participate in new narratives and new projects, capturing higher potential returns. He also revealed that Merlin will continue to optimize the BTCfi ecosystem, expand AI-driven chain abstraction technology, and launch a series of user-friendly products in the next stage to promote BTC as a true &quot;universal currency&quot; on the chain.

      <title>Trump-linked World Liberty Financial buys over 3,400 ETH for $13.00 million, onchain data showsWorld Liberty Financial, a crypto project linked to U.S. President Donald Trump, spent millions to acquire more Ethereum on Tuesday as the cryptocurrency sees surging institutional demand.

Citing Arkham Intelligence data, onchain researcher Lookonchain reported that World Liberty added 3,473 ETH at an average price of $3,743 across a number of wallets during Tuesday evening. It appears to have staked some of the newly acquired ether.

The project currently owns roughly 73,616 ETH, worth about $275.9 million at current market prices, according to Lookonchain.

World Liberty&apos;s move comes amid rising institutional demand for ether. On Tuesday, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds recorded $533.9 million in net inflows, while spot bitcoin ETFs saw a net outflow of $67.9 million, according to SoSoValue data.

The Block&apos;s price page shows that ether remained flat in the past 24 hours at $3,729. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency rose 20% in the past week and 67.1% in the past 30 days.

Meanwhile, World Liberty is preparing for the upcoming unlock of its WLFI token. The team said last week that it is aiming to have WLFI to officially begin trading within the next two months.

&quot;We&apos;re targeting 6 to 8 weeks for the full awakening — strategic alignments (alliances, grand stages, smart unlocks) take time to realize full potential,&quot; the project said last week. [Lookonchain]</title>

      <title>Goldman Sachs: Expects Trump administration to raise base tariff rate to 15%Goldman Sachs&apos; chief U.S. economist, David Mericle, expects the U.S.&apos;s base &quot;like-for-like&quot; tariff rate to increase from 10% to 15%, with tariffs on copper and critical minerals reaching 50% - a move that could exacerbate inflationary pressures and dampen economic growth. To reflect the new tariff assumptions and incorporate the impact of import tariffs in an &quot;initial observation,&quot; Goldman Sachs has adjusted its forecasts for U.S. inflation and GDP growth accordingly. Goldman Sachs lowered its core inflation forecast for 2025 from 3.4% to 3.3%, raised its 2026 forecast from 2.6% to 2.7%, and raised its 2027 forecast from 2.0% to 2.4%. Mericle said tariffs are expected to cumulatively push up core prices by 1.7% over 2-3 years. He added that tariffs would reduce GDP growth by 1 percentage point this year, 0.4 percentage points in 2026, and 0.3 percentage points in 2027. Goldman Sachs has accordingly lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.0%. (Golden Ten) [Odaily Planet Daily News]</title>
