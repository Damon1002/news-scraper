      <title>Bitmine Plans To Invest Over $2 Billion In Ethereum with Stock SaleBitmine is planning to substantially expand its Ethereum holdings, taking a treasury of $2 billion to $4.5 billion with a major stock sale. The firm conducted a sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald to help enable this move. Many companies are making huge ETH investments at the moment, generating record inflows and surging prices. A new all-time high for Ethereum is distinctly plausible, which seems encouraging for the mining firm. Bitmine Bets Big on Ethereum Bitmine was initially a Bitcoin mining firm, but this industry has become less profitable in recent months. Earlier this July, the company announced a bold $250 million Ethereum investment , joining a broad trend of institutional ETH purchases . Today, Bitmine submitted a filing to offer substantially more company shares to buy even more Ethereum: Bitmine currently owns $2 billion in Ethereum, but the company is planning to push this to $4.5 billion. It’s doing this through a sales agreement with ThinkEquity and Cantor Fitzgerald, a prominent Trump-aligned firm that has heavily invested in corporate crypto treasuries . The company may be making a gamble, but institutional ETH investment is on the rise . This could help reduce the risks from major Ethereum stockpiling . Since Bitmine first announced its new Ethereum policy, Peter Thiel’s fund bought a substantial stake in the firm, and Ark Invest channeled $175 million into it earlier this week. So far, today’s announcement has been bullish: To be clear, this isn’t the only bullish sign. Bitmine evidently picked a good time to back Ethereum, as its weekly inflows are at an all-time high . Waves of corporate investment have buoyed the asset’s price , and a rally to a new all-time high might be possible. Investors have raised fears of a bubble from corporate Bitcoin acquisitions, but ETH is a less saturated market. Compared to BTC , Bitmine may have more of a chance to directly influence Ethereum. Bitwise predicts $20 billion in institutional ETH investment over the next year, and Bitmine would represent over one-fifth of this. That factor may enable real protection.</title>

      <title>Ethereum holding company GameSquare purchases CryptoPunk NFT as treasury asset for $5.15 million in preferred sharesIn something of a novel move for the increasingly saturated crypto treasury space, Ethereum holding company GameSquare (ticker GAME) has acquired a CryptoPunk NFT. The firm says it will now hold the “iconic” piece as a “strategic treasury asset.”

GameSquare purchased the token — Punk #5577, one of just 24 “Ape Punks” — for $5.15 million in an equity trade with its previous owner, DeFi OG Robert Leshner. The preferred stock will be convertible into common shares at $1.50 per share.

Leshner, the founder of Superstate and Compound, appears to have purchased CryptoPunk #5577 in February 2022 for 2,501 ETH, equivalent to approximately $7.7 million at the time. The asset is distinguished by its cowboy hat.

The 10,000 token CryptoPunks series was one of the earliest experiments with non-fungible tokens when launched in 2017. Yuga Labs, which bought the CryptoPunks IP from creator Larva Labs in March 2022, sold the project to the nonprofit Infinite Node Foundation in May of this year.

“This isn’t just our first grail NFT, it’s a signal of how we’re thinking differently and expanding our existing footprint in digital culture by building a next-generation media company with crypto in its DNA,” Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare, said in a statement.

GameSquare is one of many newly emerging Ethereum treasury firms. Early this month, the firm’s board approved a $100 million ETH treasury authorization, which was later expanded to $250 million. The firm has acquired approximately 10,170.74 ETH, now worth $52 million, as of July 21.

Unlike other ETH balance sheet plays that typically stake their holdings for yield, GameSquare said it will pursue higher returns through DeFi deployments, namely Dialectic’s institutional Medici platform. The board also approved an initial $10 million allocation to an NFT yield strategy, targeting 6%–10% annualized returns.

According to the announcement on Thursday, Leshner has joined the firm as an advisor and will help it tokenize its GAME shares on the Superstate platform.

Recently, Leshner’s attempt at a hostile takeover of a “low market cap” liquor firm to start a crypto treasury was thwarted after its executives diluted his ownership.

      <title>JPMorgan Chase: Crypto market inflows have reached $60.00B so far this year, with investors&apos; interest in altcoins on the riseJPMorgan Chase analysts estimate that $600.00B in capital has flowed into digital assets since the beginning of the year, mainly driven by inflows into crypto funds, active trading in CME futures, and venture capital fundraising activities. Analysts point out that inflows have grown by nearly 50.00% since the end of May and are on track to easily surpass last year&apos;s historical record. Analysts say that the increasingly friendly regulatory environment in the United States is one of the key drivers. Investor interest in altcoins is also on the rise. Among them, Ethereum is the biggest beneficiary due to its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, and its increasing inclusion in corporate treasury allocations along with Bitcoin. More and more asset management companies intend to launch crypto ETFs based on altcoins and introduce staking mechanisms. (The Block) [Odaily Planet Daily News]</title>

      <title>BlackRock Ethereum ETF&apos;s assets exceeded $10 billion in one yearReported on July 24 that according to The Block, BlackRock&apos;s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) ETHA has exceeded $10 billion in assets under management in less than a year, becoming the third ETF in history to reach this milestone within a year. Eric Balchunas, senior analyst at Bloomberg ETF, said on the X platform that ETHA&apos;s assets jumped from $5 billion to $10 billion in just 10 days, showing the strong appeal of Ethereum among institutional investors. Data shows that on July 23, the cumulative inflows of nine tradable Ethereum funds in the United States reached $8.65 billion, while ETHA had a net inflow of $325 million on the same day. Analysts predict that ETFs and Ethereum-related companies may purchase $20 billion worth of Ethereum in the next year, further boosting market demand. [PANews]</title>

      <title>UK is Sitting On Billions In Bitcoin, But How Will The Government Use It?This week, the United Kingdom made headlines after reports revealed it was considering selling $7.00 billion worth of Bitcoin confiscated during a 2018 law enforcement seizure. The extra cash comes at a crucial time for the UK as it grapples with a fragile financial position. While the UK considers selling its seized Bitcoin, doing so could lead to billions in lost opportunities. Mark Pearce, General Counsel at Alkimi, emphasized that the situation presents a complex dilemma rather than a clear-cut solution for the UK. A £5 Billion Question For British Leaders The United Kingdom’s Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is currently sitting on over 61,000 Bitcoins worth over £5.00 billion. The substantial stockpile came from a major law enforcement seizure in 2018 that disrupted a major money laundering operation in the UK. The funds originated from a massive Chinese Ponzi scheme that had defrauded approximately 128,000 investors in China since 2014. Recent reports suggest that Reeves is considering selling these confiscated Bitcoin assets to help address the UK’s weakened fiscal position. The government faces significant financial challenges, with a budget deficit of £57.80 billion. The UK’s national debt has also reached historically high levels, currently amounting to £2.87 trillion. These financial pressures, paired with increasing costs for paying interest on that debt and growing demands for government spending, are creating a significant political challenge for the current government. Given the context, it’s no surprise that the Chancellor is considering filling in the gaps with revenue from selling its Bitcoin stockpile. The UK’s Fiscal Tightrope The UK government selling its seized Bitcoin could help close the current hole in its public finances. Such an injection could reduce further government borrowing, easing pressure on the national debt and associated interest payments. Skeptics who perceive Bitcoin as a highly volatile and unproductive asset would also celebrate the move. Some see the government holding billions of pounds worth of a speculative asset as imprudent when public finances are strained. Selling allows it to deploy this capital for immediate public benefit. Since the amount the government would sell is small compared to Bitcoin’s total market capitalization, the market impact would be minimal. However, he also questioned whether it would be prudent for the government to sell these assets in the short term. To Sell Or Not To Sell? Though Jian Wen, one of the key money laundering facilitators behind the Chinese Ponzi scheme, has been convicted and sentenced, other parts of the criminal case are still ongoing. Specifically, the fate of the Bitcoin stockpile is still subject to continuing civil recovery proceedings. The UK government is actively seeking to formalize its ownership of the assets for the Treasury. Until this process is finalized, Pearce believes the government should not sell off its holdings. This waiting period also offers a welcome delay for Bitcoin enthusiasts, who believe the UK should hold onto its Bitcoin to benefit from its increasing value. The High Cost of Selling Early Selling the seized Bitcoin offers the UK government immediate financial benefits, but also risks forfeiting significant future gains. Selling now means locking in the current value and potentially forfeiting billions of pounds that would be generated if Bitcoin’s price continues to climb. This risk has already been compared to when former Chancellor Gordon Brown sold off a significant portion of the UK’s gold reserves. The UK can also look to its German neighbor as an example of a missed opportunity. Last July, Germany sold nearly 50,000 BTC for over $2.89 billion. Authorities reportedly chose to sell due to concerns about the cryptocurrency’s volatility. Almost immediately after the sales, Bitcoin’s price continued its upward trajectory. Today, it rests at $118,400. Arkham Intelligence estimated that if Germany had held onto the Bitcoin, its value would have been $5.24 billion by May 2025. What Lies Ahead: A Blueprint for Seized Crypto The UK government faces a highly disputed decision. While the immediate multi-billion-pound windfall from selling its seized Bitcoin offers a crucial lifeline for its strained public finances, it must carefully weigh this against the significant gamble of potentially missing out on even greater future gains. Whatever it decides will shape the global conversation on how governments should manage digital assets born from illicit activity.</title>

      <title>U.S. House of Representatives promotes the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, emphasizing its non-partisan natureOn July 24, according to Eleanor Terrett, at a press conference before the House of Representatives&apos; August recess, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said he would work hard to win more Senate Democrats&apos; support for his Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. The bill aims to make it clear that blockchain developers and infrastructure providers (such as miners, validators, and node operators) are not considered money transmitters as long as they do not host funds. Emmer called the bill a &quot;non-partisan issue,&quot; emphasizing that there are clear rules to protect Americans and innovators, and said he welcomes the Senate&apos;s adjustments and improvements to the bill during the review process.
