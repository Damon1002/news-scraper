      <title>EigenLayer introduces multi-chain verification on Base, enabling AVS to expand beyond Ethereum L1On July 25, according to The Block, Eigen Labs launched a new feature called &quot;Multi-chain Verification,&quot; which is a change in the way active verification services operate in the EigenLayer ecosystem. AVS was previously limited to Ethereum&apos;s Layer 1, but can now be deployed to multiple chains, including Layer 2 networks, through an integrated process. This feature has been launched on the Base Sepolia test network, and the main network is expected to be fully open in the third quarter. Through this upgrade, AVS developers can quickly configure smart contract parameters, complete multi-chain deployment within hours, and use the low-cost and high-throughput characteristics of Layer 2 to improve service performance. Eigen Labs also released the EigenCloud platform last month, which integrates core services such as data availability and dispute resolution. [PANews]</title>

On the other hand, it is still a bit clunky. We don&apos;t use gold as money today, and similarly, we don&apos;t use Bitcoin as a primary means of payment for everyday economic activities today.

      <title>Voltage CEO: By 2028, Lightning Network may handle at least 5% of global stablecoin transactionsOn July 25, according to Cointelegraph, Graham Krizek, founder and CEO of Voltage, a Lightning Network payment service provider, said in an interview that with the popularity of the Layer 2 network, by 2028, the Lightning Network will handle at least 5% of the world&apos;s stablecoin transactions. He said that stablecoins will accelerate the popularity of the Lightning Network because it is the best expansion tool for stablecoins, and the network&apos;s stablecoin transactions may reach billions of dollars. At present, there are few stablecoin trading activities on the Lightning Network, but the situation may change soon. &quot;Stablecoins have just entered the Lightning Network, and major participants such as Tether have not yet been launched. The transaction volume accounts for almost zero, but it will grow in the second half of this year.&quot; Tether announced in January this year that it will launch USDT that supports the native Lightning Network. Changes may have begun since then. [PANews]</title>

      <title>In the past 12 hours, 14,273 BTC suspected to be from a &quot;Fossil Hand Whale&quot; were recharged to major exchanges in batches by Galaxy Digital.On July 25, according to the monitoring of on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa, 14,273 BTC suspected to belong to the &quot;14-year BTC holder&quot; were recharged by Galaxy Digital in batches to major exchanges (about 1.67 billion US dollars) in the past 12 hours, of which 5,690 BTC were transferred in the past hour. Two sets of data show that this time there is a high probability that they are really selling: Binance BTC spot trading has traded more than 10,000 in 4 hours; Galaxy Digital has withdrawn some USDT from the exchange after recharging BTC. At noon today, Galaxy has withdrawn 200.00 million USDT from Binance and OKX, and then distributed 140.00 million of them to 5 new addresses. It should be that some of them are being sold and sorted out. At present, Galaxy still holds 33,763 BTC (about 3.90 billion US dollars) on the chain. Subsequently, the analyst released an update saying that the seven new addresses that received USDT should be Coinbase recharge addresses, and a total of 200.00 million USDT tokens have been recharged into hot wallets. It seems that the “Fossil Hand Whale” has chosen to settle at Coinbase. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Hong Kong’s OSL Group secures $300 million in equity funding to fuel global expansionHong Kong-based OSL Group has secured $300.00 million in equity financing to support its global expansion.

In a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, OSL said that it has entered into an equity purchase agreement to raise approximately HK$2,355.00 million ($300.00 million).

The company said it plans to use the proceeds to fuel global expansion through strategic acquisitions. OSL also intends to use the newly raised capital for the development of payment initiatives that integrate fiat currencies, stablecoins, and major cryptocurrencies.

&quot;This $300.00 million equity raise marks a major milestone in our journey and reflects strong conviction in OSL’s digital asset strategy and execution,&quot; said Ivan Wong, chief financial officer of OSL Group. &quot;The funding will accelerate our global buildout — particularly in regulated payment infrastructure and access points.&quot;

OSL&apos;s latest funding move comes as Hong Kong&apos;s new stablecoin licensing regime is expected to take effect on Aug. 1. The upcoming framework mandates licensing from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins.

Global expansion appears to be at the forefront of OSL&apos;s agenda. Last month, OSL announced a $15.00 million deal to acquire Evergreen Crest, the operator of a cryptocurrency exchange in Indonesia. In February, the company completed its acquisition of the Japanese crypto exchange CoinBest and renamed it OSL Japan.

      <title>WOO X: The attack was caused by a phishing attack on a team member&apos;s device, which gave the attacker access to the development environmentOn July 25, cryptocurrency trading platform WOO X released an update on the X platform saying that the attack originated from a team member&apos;s device being hacked in a targeted phishing attack, allowing the attacker to access the development environment. Although multiple security measures restricted access rights, it still gave the attacker time to coordinate a series of withdrawal operations from the user account mentioned in the previous message. The team is conducting a comprehensive forensic review and is prioritizing the reopening of withdrawal services for all users. Once the relevant work is completed, the progress will be updated here immediately. Previously, WOO X said that the attack has caused a loss of $14.00 million and promised to fully compensate the affected users. [PANews]</title>
