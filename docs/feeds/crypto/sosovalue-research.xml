      <title>US Judge Denies Brothers&apos; Motion to Dismiss $25.00M Crypto Fraud ChargesU.S. Judge Jessica Clarke has denied a motion by MIT graduates, the Peraire-Bueno brothers, to dismiss a $25.00M crypto fraud indictment. The two are accused of exploiting a vulnerability in the Ethereum network in May 2024 by deploying 16 validator nodes and 529.5 ETH to execute a four-step &quot;bait-block-search-spread&quot; arbitrage attack, intercepting transaction profits from MEV bots within 12 seconds. The judge ruled that their actions constituted wire fraud, despite the defense&apos;s claim that &quot;system rules allowed it.&quot; The case is set to go to trial in October 2025, and the brothers still face felony charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

      <title>90-Day Correlation Between Bitcoin Volatility Index and S&amp;P 500 VIX Hits All-Time HighOn July 24, according to CoinDesk, data showed that the 90-day correlation coefficient between the Bitcoin 30-day Implied Volatility Index (BVIV/DVOL) and the S&amp;P 500 Volatility Index (VIX) hit a record high of 0.88, indicating that the linkage between the cryptocurrency market and the volatility of US stocks has significantly increased. The current correlation coefficient remains at a high level of 0.75. Analysts pointed out that this phenomenon reflects that Wall Street institutions are dominating this round of crypto market cycle. Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said that institutional investors have compressed volatility by selling a large number of call options, making Bitcoin price movements increasingly affected by the risk appetite of traditional markets. Since the beginning of this year, the BVIV index has dropped from 67% to 42%, while the price of Bitcoin has risen by 26% during the same period, breaking the historical pattern of the two fluctuating in the same direction.

      <title>PancakeSwap’s Infinity hits Base chain. Will CAKE price follow and hit new highs?PancakeSwap Infinity DEX has just launched on Base, bringing its advanced DeFi features to the Ethereum L2 as PancakeSwap’s CAKE token price tests key resistance, eyeing $4. PancakeSwap’s decentralized exchange, PancakeSwap Infinity, has officially launched on Base, bringing Infinity’s powerful features — including dynamic fee structures via customizable Hooks, dual pool types, and major gas-saving optimizations — to one of the fastest-growing Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystems. The rollout also aligns with PancakeSwap’s broader goal of delivering scalable, low-cost DeFi across chains. The rollout on Base follows closely on the heels of Infinity’s debut on BNB Chain in late April and comes amid a surge in activity on the Base network, which recently hit record highs in both total value locked and DEX volume. It also follows the launch of PancakeSwap’s one-click cross-chain swaps via the Across Protocol, which already supports asset transfers between BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Base. CAKE price has recently tested the key horizontal resistance in the $2.80–$3.00 range. This level has acted as a significant barrier, having been tested multiple times since early January. This was accompanied by a series of higher lows, forming a well-defined ascending triangle — a bullish continuation pattern that suggests increasing buying pressure at progressively higher levels. Although the price has pulled back from the local peak of $3.00 to $2.65 at the time of writing, CAKE remains technically strong — holding above both the 20-day EMA and the ascending trendline that defines the pattern’s support. Notably, volume also spiked during the recent breakout attempt, signaling growing market interest. This, combined with CAKE’s consistent pattern of higher lows converging toward the key resistance zone, points to mounting bullish pressure that soon culminate in a breakout. A confirmed close above the $3.00 level would validate the ascending triangle breakout, setting the stage for a potential rally toward the $4.00 region, a target derived from the measured move of the triangle’s height. On the downside, the immediate support lies around $2.30, followed by the psychological $2.00 level, which forms the triangle’s base. A breakdown below these levels could invalidate the bullish setup and expose CAKE price to further downside risk toward $1.75 or lower. []</title>

      <title>Could $163 Billion FOMO Accumulation Cause Bitcoin Price’s Recovery?Bitcoin has experienced significant sideways movement recently, as the crypto king struggles to break through key resistance levels.  Despite this, Bitcoin is being actively traded, with short-term and new buyers flocking to the market. However, this influx of new capital could pose both opportunities and risks. Bitcoin Investors Have Been Busy Recent data from the URPD (UTXO Realized Price Distribution) suggests that over 1.38 million BTC, worth more than $163 billion, has been accumulated between the $115,500 and $120,000 range. This accumulation occurred within the last two weeks, a relatively short timeframe, indicating that many of these purchases are from short-term holders or new investors.  These buyers are likely to sell either to secure profits or to avoid losses if the price reverses. This dynamic could create volatile conditions, especially if Bitcoin hits resistance or experiences a downward shift. Bitcoin’s macro momentum shows mixed signals, with the Bitcoin Flow Pulse currently declining. Analyst Kyledoops noted that, unlike previous market cycles in 2017 and 2021, where Bitcoin saw a surge in flows before major sell-offs, the Bitcoin Flow Pulse is actually dropping after Bitcoin hit the $120,000 level.  This suggests that big players aren’t transferring their holdings to exchanges, signaling that there may be fewer incentives to sell from long-term holders (or “diamond hands”). As the Bitcoin Flow Pulse continues to decrease, it could suggest that institutional and major investors are adopting a more cautious approach. BTC Price Is Yet To Find Direction Bitcoin’s price has been consolidating within the range of $117,261 and $120,000. The $120,000 level, in particular, is a crucial psychological barrier. Breaching it could trigger profit-taking from investors who remain skeptical of the current rally.  Given the mixed market sentiment and the influx of short-term holders, Bitcoin is likely to continue its sideways movement. The price may gravitate toward a potential drop below $117,261, but Bitcoin is expected to maintain support above $115,000, providing a cushion against further declines. This consolidation phase could last for several days as the market digests the recent influx of capital. However, if FOMO-driven buyers remain confident and continue to hold their positions, Bitcoin could push past the $120,000 barrier and eventually target $122,000. If this happens, the current bearish sentiment would be invalidated, and Bitcoin would have the potential to rise further.</title>

      <title>Gemini adds more tokenized stock assets and launches Solana staking serviceReported on July 24 that according to Crowdfundinsider, the crypto exchange Gemini announced that it has added 14 new U.S. stock tokenized assets for EU investors, including Broadcom, Nike, Starbucks, etc., bringing the total to 37. These assets issued through the Arbitrum chain are managed by the Malta-regulated entity Gemini Intergalactic EU Artemis, which supports 24/7 trading and fragmented holdings, but does not grant voting rights. Gemini Custody simultaneously launched the Solana pledge service for ETFs and corporate clients. Canada&apos;s Purpose Investments has connected its SOLL ETF to the service, and the pledge income is directly attributed to the fund. Listed company DeFi Development Corp (DFDV) also uses the service to manage its SOL holdings and expand the scale of pledges in combination with a $5.00B credit line. [PANews]</title>
