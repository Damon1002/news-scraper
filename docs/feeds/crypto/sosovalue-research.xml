      <title>Goldman Sachs: It is expected that the Trump administration will raise the basic tariff rate to 15%On July 23, according to Jinshi, David Mericle, chief economist of Goldman Sachs in the United States, expects that the basic &quot;reciprocal&quot; tariff rate in the United States will increase from 10% to 15%, of which copper and key mineral tariffs will reach 50% - this move may increase inflationary pressure and curb economic growth. To reflect the new tariff assumptions and incorporate &quot;initial observations&quot; on the impact of import tariffs, Goldman Sachs has simultaneously adjusted its forecasts for US inflation and GDP growth. Goldman Sachs lowered its core inflation forecast from 3.4% to 3.3% in 2025, raised its forecast from 2.6% to 2.7% in 2026, and raised its forecast from 2.0% to 2.4% in 2027. Mericle said that tariffs are expected to push up core prices by 1.7% cumulatively within 2-3 years. He added that tariffs will reduce GDP growth by 1 percentage point this year, 0.4 percentage points in 2026, and 0.3 percentage points in 2027. Goldman Sachs accordingly lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 1.0%. [PANews]</title>

      <title>FTX Hearing: Creditors in restricted jurisdictions may choose to transfer their claims to non-restricted jurisdictions for claimsOn July 23, FTX Historian, an account that tracks FTX&apos;s bankruptcy and compensation, summarized the key points of last night&apos;s hearing: Previously, if a creditor was in a &quot;restricted jurisdiction&quot; (such as China or Russia), his funds would be immediately confiscated according to the initial proposal of FTX&apos;s asset recovery party. Now the situation has changed, and creditors may be able to transfer their claims to non-restricted countries. The initial motion was &quot;If the creditor is in a restricted jurisdiction, his claims or compensation will be immediately confiscated&quot;, and the updated motion is expected to limit or delete this clause. Creditors can move to non-restricted areas (such as from China to Singapore and the UAE) and receive a distribution of funds, and the jurisdiction can be changed before the distribution. Affected creditors (such as those who have completed KYC in China but live in other countries) may be able to recover their funds through this, but they need to update information and seize the opportunity. In addition, the hearing reduced the risk of debt buyers, and they are likely to increase their bids. [PANews]</title>
