      <title>Ethereum investment firm Ether Machine plans to raise $1.60 billion in IPOOn July 22, Ether Reserve, a new crypto enterprise backed by well-known crypto investors, will be listed on the Nasdaq through a merger with blank check company Dynamix Corporation, and is expected to raise more than $1.6 billion. The merged entity will be named &quot;Ether Machine&quot; and aims to have more than 400,000 Ethereum on its balance sheet, making it the largest public tool for institutions to access the world&apos;s second-largest cryptocurrency. Dynamix shares rose nearly 28% in early trading. The deal highlights the growing interest of institutions in holding cryptocurrencies on corporate balance sheets. In recent months, several projects have announced plans to go public while aiming to package crypto assets into stocks to attract traditional investors. [PANews]</title>

      <title>3 Altcoins That Could Hit All-Time Highs in The Fourth Week Of July 2025The crypto market’s ongoing growth is propelling several tokens toward new highs, with many already achieving this milestone in the past week. Among those poised to follow suit is BNB, which is on track to make history. BeInCrypto has identified two additional altcoins that are quickly approaching their all-time highs and could soon set new records. XRP XRP price recently marked a new all-time high, reaching $3.66 for the first time in over six months. While the altcoin experienced a slight dip shortly after, it now trades just 3.2% below its ATH, signaling strong investor interest. The exponential moving averages show a bullish Golden Cross and are currently serving as dynamic support. This technical signal suggests that XRP is primed for continued gains. A breakout past the $3.66 level could propel the altcoin toward $3.80, enabling it to set a fresh all-time high. For token TA and market updates : Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here . However, profit-taking remains a risk as some investors may look to cash in on recent gains. If selling pressure intensifies, XRP price could break below the $3.38 support level. A fall to $3.00 would invalidate the bullish outlook and potentially mark the beginning of a broader correction. BNB BNB price is currently trading at $761, just 4% short of breaching its all-time high of $793. Investors have waited seven months for this moment. To achieve a breakout, the altcoin must first secure $741 as a stable support. The Parabolic SAR indicator is currently positioned below the candlesticks, acting as a strong signal of bullish momentum. This technical pattern suggests an ongoing uptrend. If sustained, BNB could surpass the $793 mark and also climb to $810, setting a new all-time high and reinforcing investor optimism. However, a premature sell-off could hinder this rally. If BNB fails to hold the $741 support level, it risks declining to $700. Such a drop would invalidate the bullish outlook and may trigger a wave of caution across the market, especially among short-term traders banking on a breakout. Hyperliquid (HYPE) HYPE is positioned to chart a new all-time high, provided it secures $46.94 as solid support. Maintaining this floor could pave the way for HYPE to extend its upward momentum in the near term. Currently trading at $46.89, HYPE is just over 6% away from breaching its all-time high of $49.87, recorded last week. The Ichimoku Cloud forming below the candlesticks signals growing bullish strength. This technical setup indicates a high probability for HYPE to surpass the $50.00 mark soon. However, if HYPE fails to establish $46.94 as reliable support, the bullish outlook could be invalidated. A drop toward $42.30 would represent a significant correction, erasing recent gains. Such a reversal would also reduce investor confidence and signal a potential shift in short-term market sentiment. [BeInCrypto]</title>

      <title>Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm&apos;s trial shaken as defense eyes mistrial over witness testimony: reportsLawyers for Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm are reportedly weighing a potential mistrial after raising concerns about the government&apos;s evidence. According to the defense, prosecutors called a victim of a pig butchering scam to the stand who may never have used the privacy-preserving crypto mixer.

As Storm heads into the second week of his trial, Storm&apos;s lawyer David Patton pushed against the witness&apos; assertion that her stolen crypto had been laundered through Tornado Cash, according to reporting from DL News and CoinDesk.

Hanfeng Ling had earlier testified that she had fallen for a pig butchering scam in 2021 and said that a &quot;crypto recovery service&quot; she had used had said some of the funds had gone through Tornado Cash. However, over the weekend, Storm&apos;s lawyers said they were not able to track Ling&apos;s funds to Tornado Cash.

Ethereum security expert Taylor Monahan posted on X over the weekend that scammers do not use Tornado Cash. In a series a posts, Monahan detailed why she believed the funds did not go through Tornado Cash.

&quot;Due to the aforementioned crackhead explosion tracing, I already knew that her funds did NOT go to Tornado,&quot; Monahan said. &quot;I have no clue what they were tracing. There&apos;s no Tornado Cash.&quot;

Storm&apos;s trial began last week in a federal court in Manhattan. In 2023, Storm was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and sanctions violations for operating Tornado Cash. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 45 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty. [DL News and CoinDesk]</title>

      <title>The Dream of Banking the Third World is Still Alive with AztecoAzteco, the international Bitcoin gift card company, has announced a series of partnerships with digital gift card distributors that unlock 598 million new potential buyers, with an expected 1.3 billion potential customers as the rollout of distribution deals continues. “We’re turning Bitcoin from being a noun into a verb so that you can Bitcoin it,” Akin Fernandez, founder of Azteco, told Bitcoin Magazine in an exclusive interview. The company, whose brand first appeared in Bitcoin in 2014, has been focused on banking the unbanked throughout the developing world for over a decade, with Bitcoin gift cards or vouchers as the technology of choice. The new partnerships include Razor, the video game software and hardware company, which today has 240 million tech-savvy customers, according to Fernandez. Focused on Brazil, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, other distribution partnerships include Enterative®LIVE, with an estimated 30 million customers; DTOne, a global estimate of 190 million customers; KaBum!, with 8 million; and PicPay, having just cleared compliance and is expected to unlock another 60 million users in Brazil, per data shared by Fernandez. “Bitcoin has all the utility of money and that’s an absolutely enormous market, the size of which makes the current price of bitcoin completely irrational,” Fernandez added when discussing the potential market size of Bitcoin. Azteco, who originally raised $6 million in seed funding from various angel investors, including Jack Dorsey, has now launched a new seed extension raise, targeting $4 million to fund the expansion. “My contribution to Azteco comes out of a deep respect for their mission. The unbanked population is immense. We have the technology and resources to close this gap, but until now, no one has taken that important next step. Azteco is providing so much more than just access to a secure financial system; it is building an ecosystem of financial self-determination that is secure and supported by local communities. I am honored to support them.” — Jack Dorsey, Block. Banking the unbanked, a popular slogan of an older generation of Bitcoiners, is still alive and well in Azteco. Popularized by Andreas Antonopoulos around 2014, this mission statement for Bitcoin highlighted the vast gap in access to financial services and technologies between the Western elite — be it in New York or London — to that of the rest of the world. The unbanked often lack the to basic access to long-distance financial rails, reasonably priced credit and the relative security of a normal bank account. Proponents of banking the unbanked as a clear use case of Bitcoin argued that, as a technology, it could go a lot further than banks since it doesn’t need to identify its users; bitcoin simply works as a bearer asset regardless of who controls or or where in the world it is sent from. Access to cheap mobile phones and basic telecommunications infrastructure like text messages, allowed novel implementations of Bitcoin to exist and function in environments where traditional Western banks simply could not justify the administration and onboarding costs. “To experience the future of money. To gain a glimpse into an exciting technology. To learn about how money could be in the future and also become aware of how limited money and banks are today. For the ‘other 6 billion’ who don’t enjoy international, control-free banking as we do, bitcoin represents an opportunity to become part of a global economy which up till now did not exist. For those users, bitcoin is more than just a curiosity, it might be a doorway to connect to the world.” — Antonoplous, 2015. This vision for Bitcoin began to struggle as the transaction fees of sending BTC on-chain started to spike around 2017, leading to the infamous Blocksize wars and, as a consequence, the build-out of the Lightning Network. Azteco vouchers could be purchased as early as 2014. Fast-forward to 2025, and Azteco has upgraded its technology from natively using Bitcoin on-chain addresses in its vouchers in 2014 to adding Lightning Network support via the LNURL standard via compatible apps like Wallet of Satoshi, Muun or Blink. The deep experience Azteco has with the Bitcoin technology stack is self-evident in their design today, which removes an incredible amount of friction from normal ways of buying bitcoin and delivers it in a beautiful package. Going further than the economic argument for servicing an unbanked and underbanked population, out of reach of the legacy banking system, Fernandez differentiates between ethical and unethical bitcoin along the same lines. In an unpublished document on the matter, shared with Bitcoin Magazine, Fernandez writes: “What is ‘Ethical Bitcoin’? This can best be described by stating what it is not. It is not ethical to connect a user’s identity to the money they use, or the content of the messages they send on a network. It is unethical to cut people off from being able to use their money. It is unethical to surveil people and then use that information to control them. It is unethical to arbitrarily block people from selling goods and services.” With this statement, Fernandez strikes at the fundamental, structural difference between legacy finance and Bitcoin. Censorship resistance; confidence that users can access their accounts and transfer value without the need for personal information, despite the way the political winds are blowing — that is Bitcoin’s killer app. A very different mindset than popular generations of Bitcoiners who, in internet parlance, seem to mostly just care about NGU (“number go up), even if it’s in the form of an ETF or bitcoin treasury company. Nothing wrong with that, but perhaps this generation of Bitcoiners has either forgotten or not been exposed to enough content by Andreas Antonopoulos. They might not realize how big a portion of the global market is cut off from legacy finance, how many are unbanked. Azteco’s thesis is far from just ideological; there’s a big market at play. Focusing on the prepaid phone data market, Fernandez points out that “there are 3.4 billion users of prepaid mobile smartphones” worldwide. Which means that almost half of the global population has access to smartphones and is already used to topping up their phones “on an ad hoc basis,” including via digital vouchers of various kinds. Every one of these users of the internet network is capable of installing “Wallet of Satoshi, Proton Wallet, Blockstream App or BitKey; all they have to do is take 30 seconds to put it on their Android or iPhone,” he adds. The utility of bitcoin to them is not that different from sending a WhatsApp message, says Fernandez, which, for near-zero cost, allows billions of people in the developing world to coordinate across great distances every day. Bitcoin unlocks the same velocity but for the transfer of monetary value, be it in the form of payments or remittances, while also serving as an accessible safe-haven asset from their local fiat currencies — most of which are trending to zero compared to bitcoin. Fernandez notes that “The remittances market is very, very, very large, it is worth $782 billion a year. Imagine we take, I don’t know, 12% of that, or 15% of that and switch them all onto bitcoin. That would be a super disruptive event.” He added that “just like in WhatsApp, if you have a family of 15 people and you put them all onto Wallet of Satoshi or Blockstream Wallet then all of a sudden you have a lot of people who are moving bitcoin from and to, and they all need to be fed with bitcoin.” The problem is, of course: How will they acquire the bitcoin? “If they’re not Americans or they’re not Europeans, getting bitcoin through an exchange, first of all, is very difficult. And secondly, it’s very slow and privacy-invading. Azteco vouchers are much better for them because they can go to a place where they’re already buying their video games and stuff like that, they can buy a $25 voucher or go to the supermarket and buy a $25 voucher. And then they have their bitcoin that they can send to wherever it is they want. The use case, once again, is money.” This is not just theoretical. Fernandez shared some of Azteco’s sales numbers with Bitcoin Magazine, having sold roughly “500,000 vouchers over the last couple of years” with a rough average $280-$315 in value transferred and many purchases of $20-$30. In Q1 of 2024, Bitcoin Magazine reported that Azteco had sold vouchers to a million people worldwide since their inception, suggesting an acceleration of interest throughout the developing world in recent years. Fernandez believes these numbers can be a lot bigger and the key obstacle to developing that market is user experience. “I mean we’re all at an all-time high now of what it is, $123,034 but just imagine if the whole world, just people who are on mobile phones are using bitcoin as money to send to each other, to save money and to spend online; that 123,034 is a pittance compared to the size of the market. But none of this can happen if bitcoin is hard to get. It must be trivially easy to get, as easy as topping up your mobile phone to make phone calls,” Fernandez concluded. [Bitcoin Magazine]</title>

      <title>Wall Street rallies as AI hype meets earnings realityStocks climbed toward record highs on Monday as investors looked past tariff tensions and focused on upcoming tech earnings. The Dow rose 220 points (0.52%), while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 0.58% and 0.75%, respectively. Traders are piling into tech shares ahead of key results from Alphabet and Tesla, both set to report on Wednesday. Optimism is high—but so are valuations, drawing warnings from economists who see signs of a growing AI-fueled bubble. Apollo’s chief economist, Torsten Slok, said valuations for top S&amp;P 500 firms, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, now exceed their peaks from the dot-com era. Traders are bidding up tech stocks ahead of key earnings reports. Notably, both Alphabet and Tesla will release their earnings on Wednesday, the first among the major tech giants this quarter. Strong results could validate the market’s optimism and high valuations. Still, the market’s focus on the AI sector is increasingly drawing comparisons to the 1999 tech bubble. Torsten Slok, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, stated that the AI bubble could be even worse than the dot-com bubble. Torsten Slok: &quot;The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s&quot; pic.twitter.com/OEervHU4WG Slok explained that the top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 are now more overvalued than they were in the 1990s. Specifically, he compared the P/E ratios of major firms such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, and found they were higher than at the absolute peak of the dot-com bubble. Moreover, traders remain concerned over U.S. trade policy, as tensions with the EU escalate. The European Union is preparing for a trade reprisal if it doesn’t get a deal with the U.S. “If they want war, they will get war,” WSJ quoted one German official referencing the trade negotiations. This is a response to President Donald Trump’s escalating demands toward the EU and other trading partners. Earlier, Trump pushed for a 20% minimum tariff on EU goods, up from 15% proposed earlier. On the other hand, the EU aims to obtain a 10% baseline tariff, with special consideration for certain industries.</title>
