      <title>Bloomberg: White House to Allow 401(k) Investments in Crypto, Blackstone Expects Large Private Equity Firms to Dominate MarketChainCatcher News, according to Bloomberg, the White House is preparing an executive order that will provide legal protection for 401(k) retirement plan managers, allowing them to include private market funds, cryptocurrencies, and other alternative assets in their investment options. Blackstone Inc. President Jon Gray said that once the U.S. paves the way for 401(k) plans to expand into investment areas beyond stocks and bonds, leading institutions in the alternative asset industry will be the most likely to benefit. This move will bring significant changes to the U.S. retirement savings market, providing ordinary investors with more diversified investment channels, and may also create new business growth opportunities for large private equity management companies.

      <title>CICC: Stablecoins have the potential to become a new type of infrastructureAccording to Zhitong Finance, a research report by CICC states that stablecoins have the potential to become a new type of infrastructure. By analyzing the incentive compatibility mechanisms of various participants in stablecoins, the report envisions the potential impact of stablecoins on financial markets and the international monetary system, and further explores China&apos;s response. We believe that the nascent stage of infrastructure is an important development opportunity, and issuing offshore RMB stablecoins may be China&apos;s preferred choice for participating in stablecoin development. However, it should be noted that stablecoins are only a &quot;technique&quot; for promoting the internationalization of the RMB. Whether the RMB can become a widely trusted international currency ultimately depends on the &quot;principles,&quot; namely the &quot;legal anchor&quot; and &quot;functional anchor&quot; of the RMB.

      <title>Ripple co-founder-related addresses transferred approximately $140.00M worth of XRP to trading platforms in the past 7 days.According to on-chain investigator ZachXBT, since July 17, an address long associated with Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has transferred 50,000,000 XRP. The wallet appears to have transferred approximately $140,000,000.00 worth of tokens into three addresses associated with trading platforms, while another 10,000,000 XRP were deposited into two newly created wallets. Addresses controlled by Chris Larsen still hold approximately 2,810,000,000 XRP, worth about $9,000,000,000.00. Previously, the SEC accused Ripple&apos;s CEO Brad Garlinghouse of personally cashing out $150,000,000.00 worth of XRP over three years when it sued Ripple in 2020. In addition, Larsen and his spouse sold $450,000,000.00 worth of tokens between 2017 and 2020. [Foresight News]</title>
