      <title>Crypto mining malware makes a comeback, with over 3,500 websites implanted with Monero mining scripts.On July 22, according to Decrypt, a wave of stealthy browser crypto-mining attacks is spreading across the web, with over 3,500 websites being injected with secret Monero mining scripts. Cybersecurity firm c/side first discovered the still-active attack campaign. Unlike traditional cryptojacking, this malware avoids the obvious characteristics of traditional cryptojacking by limiting CPU usage and hiding traffic in WebSocket streams. Attackers follow a &quot;stay low, mine slow&quot; strategy, reusing access gained from past attacks, targeting unpatched websites and e-commerce servers. According to an anonymous information security researcher, the attackers have likely gained control of thousands of hacked WordPress websites and e-commerce stores. The malware uses throttled WebAssembly miners, limiting CPU usage and communicating via WebSockets, making it difficult to detect by traditional methods. [Techflow TechFlow]</title>

      <title>SpaceX moves $150 million in bitcoin after three-year dormancy: ArkhamOn Tuesday, Elon Musk&apos;s aerospace company SpaceX moved its crypto holdings for the first time in three years.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, SpaceX-linked wallet address &quot;15oKQ…7Jf1G&quot; moved 1,308 BTC ($150 million) to a new address &quot;bc1q8…hartf.&quot;

This marks the company&apos;s first crypto transaction since June 10, 2022, a period during which the firm regularly sent multiple batches of about 1,200 BTC to Coinbase. Between May 25 and June 10, 2022, SpaceX transferred 17,314 BTC to the cryptocurrency exchange.

SpaceX did not officially announce the crypto transaction nor reveal the reason for moving the bitcoin. The Block has reached out to the company for comments.

Following the latest transaction, SpaceX currently holds 6,977 BTC, worth $825 million, according to Arkham. Tesla, another company owned by Musk, holds 11,509 BTC ($1.36 billion).

Last month, Arkham wrote on X that Tesla and SpaceX held over $2 billion in bitcoin, which was acquired at an average price of around $32,000. &quot;Combined, Elon’s companies are up almost $1.5 BILLION on bitcoin,&quot; Arkham wrote.

Tuesday&apos;s Bitcoin movement from SpaceX coincides with accelerating mainstream adoption of bitcoin and crypto, significantly boosted by President Donald Trump&apos;s strong pro-crypto stance and recent advancements in crypto-friendly legislation. This trend has prompted numerous traditional finance firms to establish corporate bitcoin treasuries or launch crypto-infused services.

Meanwhile, Musk, a former close ally of Trump prior to their public fallout, recently announced the formation of the &quot;America Party,&quot; a new political entity aiming to challenge the two-party system. Musk stated on X that his new party would support bitcoin. [Arkham Intelligence]</title>
