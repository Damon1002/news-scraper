      <title>Should Investors Buy Low-Cap Altcoins in Q3 2025? Analysts Weigh InCrypto investors are well aware of the risks involved in low-cap altcoins. However, this segment often delivers impressive returns, sometimes multiplying investments several times over. So, should investors start buying low-cap altcoins in July, especially now that experts believe altcoin season has begun? Opportunities and Risks for Low-Cap Altcoins in Q3 2025 Although the total market cap reached a new high in July, capital flows mainly into Bitcoin and major altcoins. TradingView data supports this. While the total crypto market cap nears $4 trillion, the market cap excluding the top 100 altcoins stands at just $15.4 billion. CoinMarketCap data shows that the top 100 altcoins each have a market cap above $700 million. Altcoins outside this group—those below $700 million—are categorized as mid-cap or low-cap. This capital disparity suggests that investors remain cautious. They prefer altcoins with high liquidity or those that institutional players and listed companies notice. However, another interpretation offers hope. Some analysts believe the current capital inflow is still in its early phase . Many analysts share the same view as investor Mister Crypto. According to them, the market is still in phase two. In this stage, investors mostly favor Ethereum . Capital will eventually rotate to large, mid, and low caps . This delay creates a window of opportunity for many investors to buy early and at a good price . It’s also a chance to get ahead of the broader capital flow. Still, analysts like João Wedson remain skeptical of ultra-low-cap altcoins—especially those outside the top 300. These coins usually have a market cap of less than $200 million. He cites the Open Interest to Market Cap Ratio as a warning signal for these coins. Data shows that open interest for coins outside the top 300 is unusually high compared to their market caps. When open interest significantly surpasses market capitalization, it indicates that traders are focusing on short-term movements in the derivatives market instead of actively trading the tokens in spot markets. Consequently, these altcoins experience low liquidity and encounter extreme volatility . On X, excitement about altcoin season is spreading fast in July. However, whether investors should buy low-cap altcoins in Q3/2025 still depends heavily on their personal risk appetite and investment strategy.</title>

      <title>Is Citigroup eyeing stablecoin issuance? Here’s what we knowCitigroup claims to be exploring stablecoin adoption amidst accelerated regulations in the United States and Hong Kong to accommodate. How far are they willing to dive? Major financial institutions are now seeking opportunities to benefit from the current stablecoin wave that’s been sweeping the globe. Companies in Hong Kong and the United States have expressed interest in issuing their own stablecoins pegged to local currencies. The global banking firm Citigroup is no exception. In a recent earnings call, CEO Jane Fraser said to stakeholders that the bank is currently aiming to delve deeper into stablecoins and digital assets in order to fulfill clients’ needs. In addition, the bank also hopes to attract new clients and unlock new revenue streams through stablecoins. These comments are reaffirmed by New York-based head of services at Citigroup, Shahmir Khaliq in an interview with South China Morning Post. The executive called stablecoins a “global phenomenon,” especially with recent developments in the United States and Hong Kong’s own Stablecoin Ordinance bill that is scheduled to come into effect on August 1. “We welcome regulators providing us guidance and insight on the stablecoin landscape, allowing us to continue developing new services that help our clients run their businesses every day,” said Khaliq. How far do you think banks are willing to go to embrace stablecoins? Earlier this year, the banking group expressed interest in offering technology-based services and the issuance of what they called a “Citi stablecoin.” Recently, it has also stated that its plans to help clients navigate reserve management as stablecoins require backing its value in reserves. It would also offer services that could convert stablecoins into fiat currencies and vice versa. “Consumers and companies will have multiple payment options, and ultimately, the adoption of stablecoins will depend on factors like cost and ease of access,” he said, adding that banks are able to provide the bridge between stablecoins and fiat. Although the bank is undoubtedly curious about stablecoins and how they will be able to make use of them, it is also taking a cautious stance as it observes the need for “clear accounting rules regarding stablecoins and their impact on balance sheets and liquidity” according to Khaliq. He believes that there is still a long way to go before true regulatory clarity can be achieved in terms of stablecoins, stating that it is still “very early” in its development. Back in April 2025, Citigroup’s latest report showed that stablecoin issuers are poised to become some of the largest holders of U.S. Treasuries by 2030 if the U.S. adopts a regulatory framework. Now that it has, only time will tell if it will reach the predicted $1 trillion surge in additional demand for U.S. Treasuries. Most recently, the Trump Administration passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act or GENIUS Act. It received majority vote from the House of Representatives on July 18. The bill is aimed at providing the first federal framework for stablecoins. Hong Kong is next in line. The special administrative region recently passed the Stablecoin Ordinance, which mandates companies to register for a stablecoin issuance license in order to offer services and issue stablecoins pegged to the Hong Kong dollar. It is scheduled to come into effect on August 1. Even China has begun to mull over softening its stance on digital assets as more and more countries are competing to issue their own stablecoins linked to local currencies, in an attempt to overthrow USD-pegged stablecoin dominance.

      <title>CryptoQuant analyst: Ethereum may experience a pullback in the short term, but the magnitude and duration are not expected to be too largeOn July 23, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan said that Ethereum has recently risen sharply and may experience a correction in the short term, but the magnitude and duration are not expected to be too large. He pointed out that compared with the overheated market in March and November 2024, the current market is not high. Although Ethereum has performed slowly in this cycle, it has bottomed out and may continue to rise in the second half of 2025. He also mentioned that the rise of Ethereum often drives the performance of other currencies, and investors can pay attention to the subsequent market trends. [PANews]</title>
