      <title>Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Stablecoins will have a disruptive impact on traditional bank deposits and payment systemsOn July 21, according to Phoenix.com, the latest research report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch shows that as the US stablecoin regulatory framework gradually takes effect, stablecoins will have a disruptive impact on traditional bank deposits and payment systems in the next 2-3 years. The US President has signed the GENIUS Act to set a preliminary framework for stablecoin regulation. In the short term, the stablecoin market is expected to grow by $25-75 billion, which will boost demand for US short-term Treasury bonds. Although major banks are cautious about domestic payment applications, they generally believe that cross-border payments are a feasible scenario and have begun to deploy related businesses, including JPMorgan Chase&apos;s deposit tokens and Bank of New York Mellon&apos;s custody services.

      <title>JPMorgan Chase data-charging plan could &quot;destroy&quot; crypto and fintech startups, executive warnsOn July 21, according to Fortune magazine, last month, when JPMorgan Chase informed fintech companies that it planned to charge them for accessing its customers&apos; bank account data, the move caused a strong reaction in many areas of the financial industry. According to four industry executives, the move is a blow to the fintech industry and may have a devastating impact on early startups, including those in the cryptocurrency industry. However, analysts believe that mature fintech companies such as PayPal and Block (formerly Square) may not be greatly affected by this fee adjustment.
Under the plan, the bank could charge data aggregators fees every time a consumer moves money from JPMorgan to a cryptocurrency account or a third-party service like Robinhood. Crypto and fintech companies often use aggregators like Plaid or MX to access customer accounts at major financial institutions like JPMorgan. So far, banks haven’t charged fintech companies, but that could change. Aggregators are widely expected to pass on the new fees to fintech customers, and some may even pass the costs on to consumers.
