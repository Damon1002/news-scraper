      <title>Justin Sun May Be the Cause of Most Ethereum Withdrawal EventsOver the past week, people have withdrawn as much as $1.7 billion worth of Ethereum from the lending protocol Aave. The reduction in available liquidity has caused the protocol to charge borrowers interest rates exceeding 10%. Aave contributor Marc Zeller told DL News that Justin Sun may be the cause of most of the Ethereum withdrawals, as he regularly moves large sums of money in and out of the lending protocol, &quot;He&apos;s so unpredictable, he moves billions of dollars like I go to the supermarket to buy something.&quot; Over the past three days, wallets on Arkham that users have tagged as belonging to Justin Sun have withdrawn over $646.00 million worth of Ethereum from Aave.

      <title>GitHub calls for European sovereign tech fund to support open source softwareOn July 23, according to the GitHub blog, open source software as digital infrastructure is vital to the economy and society, but its maintenance funds have long been insufficient. The GitHub Developer Policy Team commissioned Open Forum Europe, Fraunhofer ISI, and the European University Institute to conduct a feasibility study to explore the extension of the successful experience of Germany&apos;s sovereign technology institutions to the EU level and promote the establishment of the &quot;EU Sovereign Technology Fund&quot; (EU-STF). The study recommends that the fund should focus on investing in open source dependency, maintenance, security, improvement, and ecosystem construction, and proposes seven design standards, including funding pools, low bureaucracy, political independence, flexible funding, community participation, strategic alignment, and high transparency. GitHub calls on the EU to invest at least 350.00 million euros in the 2028-2035 budget, and to jointly fund with industry and countries to ensure the sustainable development and digital sovereignty of open source software.
