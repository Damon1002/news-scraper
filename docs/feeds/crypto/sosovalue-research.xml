      <title>Tesla‚Äôs futuristic diner is here, serving fries and popcorn‚Äîbut where‚Äôs the Dogecoin?Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla diner is now serving up burgers and futurism in Hollywood. However, patrons noticed the absence of Dogecoin payments, despite his earlier endorsement, turning what could‚Äôve been a crypto milestone into a missed opportunity. The grand opening of Tesla‚Äôs long-hyped ‚Äúretro-futuristic‚Äù diner in Hollywood unfolded Monday afternoon with all the usual Musk theatrics: a 4:20 p.m. unlock time, robots behind popcorn machines, and Cybertruck-shaped trays. Tesla Diner &amp; Supercharger in Hollywood, LA Open 24/7, starting now  pic.twitter.com/nISRNoV89Y The crowd, which had gathered at the Santa Monica Boulevard diner hours before opening, cheered as Tesla‚Äôs chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, unlocked the doors.  For Dogecoin ( DOGE ) loyalists, the fanfare rang hollow. Despite Musk‚Äôs 2022 tweet insisting DOGE payments were coming, the only currency accepted was the old-fashioned kind. When one patron approached a touch screen and placed his order, he followed up with a question: ‚ÄúCan I pay in Dogecoin?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot today,‚Äù the diner employee responded. See below. üö®DOGE FAM MUST SEE THISüö® I actually went to Tesla Diner first day to ask them if they accept DOGECOIN! üëá  pic.twitter.com/3b7zeDhhsA Musk‚Äôs influence on Dogecoin‚Äôs valuation is well-documented; a single tweet from him has sent the memecoin soaring or cratering for years. His latest pivot away from crypto integration, especially at a high-profile venture blending tech and commerce, raises questions about how seriously Tesla takes digital assets. The diner‚Äôs omission of DOGE isn‚Äôt just a snub to crypto enthusiasts; it‚Äôs a missed chance to normalize cryptocurrency in everyday transactions, something Musk once championed. The Tesla diner, nestled at the intersection of electric vehicles, entertainment, and lifestyle, could have become a high-visibility proving ground for real-world crypto payments. Killing it, man! ‚ÄúNot today‚Äù paying with  $Doge . Not the answer we where hoping for but better then a flat out no Instead, the absence of Dogecoin underscores a widening gap between Musk‚Äôs rhetoric and implementation, particularly at a time when the digital assets sector is seeking tangible, everyday use cases. Whether this was a delay or a quiet reversal remains unclear, but in the current climate, silence on crypto can speak volumes. Meanwhile, Musk has already floated plans to expand the diner concept to major cities and Supercharger stops, contingent on its initial success. Whether he‚Äôll keep his word and eventually accept DOGE as a payment remains to be seen.  ‚Äú‚ÄòNot today‚Äô paying with $Doge. Not the answer we where hoping for but better then a flat out no,‚Äù another observer noted on X [sic].</title>

      <title>US seeks to recover $7.1 million in crypto tied to oil and gas fraud schemeU.S. prosecutors are seeking $7.1 million worth of cryptocurrency tied to an oil and gas investment scam.

The U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office for the Western District of Washington filed a civil action on Tuesday to get those funds.

‚ÄúThe co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,‚Äù said acting U.S. Attorney Miller in the statement. ‚ÄúFederal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.‚Äù

Geoffrey K. Auyeung, 47, who was allegedly behind the scheme, was indicted in 2024 on a slew of money laundering charges. Prosecutors say he and others persuaded victims to send money to &quot;what was represented as escrow accounts to purchase oil tank storage in either Rotterdam, Netherlands, or Houston,&quot; promising profits through renting out the oil tank storage.

Instead, prosecutors said the money was moved to 81 different accounts, taken offshore or moved to 19 crypto accounts where Bitcoin, USDT, USDC, ETH, and other assets were bought.

About $2.3 million were seized from Auyeung&apos;s bank accounts when he was arrested, prosecutors said.</title>

      <title>PENGU Could Rally 38% if One Key Price Resistance BreaksAfter a strong 26% gain over the past week, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is now hovering just below a crucial resistance level. While much of the altcoin market cools down, PENGU price looks poised to break out. Only if it can push past one key wall. A deeper look at bullish strength, liquidations, and price charts shows the token might still have room to run. PENGU Bulls Are In Complete Control Even though PENGU dropped around 2% in the past 24 hours, the bulls still seem to be holding the reins. The Bull-Bear Power (BBP) index, which compares recent highs and lows to measure market strength, is currently flashing green, at around 0.0148. This level suggests buyers still have the upper hand, despite a short-term dip. For token TA and market updates : Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya‚Äôs Daily Crypto Newsletter¬† here . In simple terms, when BBP is positive, bulls are stronger than bears. And Pengu‚Äôs BBP has remained above zero since late June, even as prices hovered below key resistance. That steady strength could be a sign that any dip is just part of a cooldown before another leg up. If BBP stays positive while price climbs past resistance, it might confirm that PENGU still has momentum. But if BBP flips negative, it could warn of a deeper pullback ahead. 7-Day Liquidation Map Shows Short-Biased Setup PENGU is currently trading around $0.036. The 7-day liquidation map shows cumulative short liquidation leverage building up to $10.46 million versus $10.18 million for longs; a slight bias toward short positions. Do note that there isn‚Äôt much to choose between Longs and  Shorts , and a price push in either direction can decide the next leg for PENGU.  However, as bulls are in power and that too by a sizable margin, as established by the BBP index, the price action could impact the short positions more than the long. If the price crosses $0.039, led by bulls breaking key resistance level, and even nears $0.042, a major liquidation cluster of shorts gets triggered. That would reduce downward pressure and potentially propel the  PENGU price  to the next key price level. The liquidation map shows a build-up of short positions; if PENGU‚Äôs price moves up fast, those betting against it may be forced to buy back, pushing the price even higher. PENGU Price Action Hints at a 38% Upside Technically, the  PENGU price  has tested the 0.382 Fibonacci level near $0.039 twice and failed to break above cleanly. It now trades just under that resistance. Do note that besides the Fib extension resistance, a key resistance of $0.037 also exists. The chart uses the Trend-based Fibonacci extension tool. It connects the swing low of $0.0077 to the last swing high of $0.035 and then to the immediately retraced price level of $0.028. This tool helps chart the next price targets for a coin/token in an uptrend.  If PENGU price manages a clean breakout above $0.037, $0.039, and then $0.042 (the 0.5 Fib zone), it opens the path to $0.045 first, a 25% surge. If that breaks, the next key resistance point, or rather target, would be $0.050, the 0.786 Fibonacci level. That would be a 38% rally from current prices around $0.036. Validation for this move comes from declining bear power, building short positions, and strong chart structure. The bullish trend would get invalidated if PENGU breaks the $0.035 resistance-turned-support. Or if it continues to drop to touch the retracement zone of the Fibonacci extension: the $0.028 mark.</title>

      <title>Dan Tapiero sees crypto ecosystem reaching $50 trillion as he launches new $500.0 million fund under 50T rebrand10T Holdings (10T) and 1RoundTable Partners (1RT), two crypto growth equity funds founded by veteran macro investor Dan Tapiero, have consolidated under a new brand, 50T, and launched a new $500.0 million fund.

The rebrand comes alongside a revised market outlook from Tapiero, who now sees the digital asset ecosystem reaching $50.0 trillion in value over the next decade ‚Äî up from his original $10.0 trillion projection in 2020.

Asked whether this referred to the global crypto market alone, Tapiero told The Block that it also includes the valuation of all public and private companies in the space.

&quot;We originally named our fund 10T because we projected the digital asset ecosystem could reach $10.0 trillion in value over the next decade. This ecosystem encompasses Bitcoin, Ethereum, all cryptocurrencies, and equity in the space. Remarkably, we&apos;ve already reached $5.0 trillion today. Looking ahead to the next decade, especially considering the recent significant changes in Washington DC, we believe there&apos;s a realistic path from today&apos;s $5.0 trillion to $50.0 trillion,&quot; Tapiero said.

The new vehicle, called 50T Fund V, is a 10-year closed-end fund focused on growth equity investments in blockchain, crypto, and web3 infrastructure. The first close is planned for the fourth quarter of this year.

The rebrand and new fund follow a string of notable exits from the firm‚Äôs portfolio, including Deribit‚Äôs recent $2.9 billion acquisition by Coinbase and the public listings of Circle and eToro. Earlier this year, 1RT Acquisition Corp. ‚Äî a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) affiliated with the firm ‚Äî raised $172.5 million in an oversubscribed IPO on Nasdaq. The SPAC focuses on digital assets and technology-enabled businesses, particularly in the cryptocurrency, blockchain, and fintech sectors.

With additional portfolio companies preparing for public listings, the firm says it is positioned to continue benefiting from what it sees as the next wave of growth in the digital asset ecosystem.

Under the combined brand, 50T currently manages $2.0 billion in assets and maintains board representation across its portfolio. The firm says its &quot;picks and shovels&quot; concentrated approach emphasizes structured downside protection and active governance.

      <title>Orphanage in Uganda That Runs on Bitcoin Celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day with a Road TripOn May 22, 2025, children from the Orphans of Uganda Children‚Äôs Center, an orphanage in eastern Uganda that‚Äôs part of the Bitcoin Kampala community, took a road trip to the zoo thanks in part to bitcoin donations from around the world. The team that helps fund and run the the orphanage chose to take the trip on Bitcoin Pizza Day to show the orphans, many of whom had never left the village in which the orphanage is located, that anything is possible, much like Laszlo Hanyecz showed the world that paying for goods and services in bitcoin is possible when he paid 10,000 bitcoin for two pizzas on May 22, 2010. 22‚Ä¢05‚Ä¢2025 ‚Äì Orphanage Bitcoin Pizza Day üòá We dreamt to leave our district on a bus to the zoo at the end of last year, you all made it happen‚Ä¶. Special Thanks to @blinkbtc , @studentofbtc , @travelwbitcoin who sponsored us for the day And our forever patrons @Bitcoinbeach ,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Ol6XC52bcv ‚ÄúWe organized this trip to give the children hope and to open their minds to what‚Äôs possible,‚Äù Brindon Mwiine, founder of Bitcoin Kampala, told Bitcoin Magazine. ‚ÄúLast year, we started teaching them to write down their dreams in notebooks we gave them, and when we asked what they wished for at Christmas, their answers were simple: visit the capital, see animals, and travel,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBitcoin Pizza Day at the Entebbe Zoo became the perfect way to bring those dreams to life while teaching them about Bitcoin.‚Äù Mwiine also noted that this was the first time the children had taken an extended bus ride, crossed the Nile, traveled through the capital city of Kampala, explored a zoo ‚Äî and tasted pizza. ‚ÄúIt was a day of firsts,‚Äù said Mwiine, who added that it was all the more special because he, the support staff and the children ‚Äúexperienced it all together as a family.‚Äù Edith Mpumwire, a member of Blink Wallet‚Äôs marketing team and someone who works with the Bitcoin Kampala team, seconded what Mwiine said. ‚ÄúThis trip is the first of its kind [for these children],‚Äù said Mpumwire in the video embedded in the X post above. ‚ÄúMost of these children are from eastern Uganda [and] they stay in a small house located in Bugiri. They have never left Bugiri, so, for them, today is the first day to not only visit the zoo, but to leave their enclosure,‚Äù she added. Mpumwire also noted how the international Bitcoin community is partially to thank for enabling the orphans to take this trip. ‚ÄúThe global [Bitcoin] community contributes to their livelihood [and] here we are taking them on a road trip [where] they get to see a mini national park, Lake Victoria and very many animals.‚Äù You can contribute to the Orphans of Uganda Children‚Äôs Center via the project‚Äôs Geyser page.</title>

      <title>KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings File with SEC, Merger Expected to Close August 11Today, KindlyMD (NASDAQ: NAKA) and Bitcoin-native firm Nakamoto Holdings announced that it has officially filed their definitive information statement with the SEC in connection with the proposed merger with Nakamoto, moving forward with a planned merger expected to close around August 11, 2025. BREAKING: üá∫üá∏ $763.00 million #Bitcoin treasury company Nakamoto files with SEC to merge with publicly traded KindlyMD. Expects to complete the merge in 20 days. pic.twitter.com/ejjMaoqI6k ‚ÄúFiling the definitive information statement is a critical milestone for this merger and accelerates our mission of acquiring one million Bitcoin,‚Äù stated the Founder and CEO of Nakamoto David Bailey. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very proud of the teams‚Äô collaboration at Nakamoto and KindlyMD to get us one step closer to closing the merger. Our shared enthusiasm for Bitcoin paired with our expertise in structuring this opportunity for public markets has created a strong foundation for the combined company‚Äôs future.‚Äù The merger is a key step in advancing Nakamoto‚Äôs strategy, which will use Bitcoin not only as a reserve asset but as the foundation of a new capital framework. Nakamoto will treat Bitcoin as the base and combine it with public stocks to grow and invest more effectively. This model supports smaller companies that hold Bitcoin in regions where direct access to it is limited. Firms like Metaplanet, Smarter Web Company, and The Blockchain Group have already shown strong results. Performance is measured by Bitcoin per share, with gains reinvested into more Bitcoin or new ventures. Nakamoto manages the 40 percent securities limit under the Investment Company Act by using Bitcoin-denominated convertible notes, giving it more flexibility and control. With over 750 million dollars raised, the merger with KindlyMD supports its goal of expanding a Bitcoin based financial model globally. ‚ÄúWe are proud to reach this important milestone alongside Nakamoto,‚Äù said the Founder and CEO of KindlyMD Tim Pickett. ‚ÄúOur shareholders now have the opportunity to be part of a groundbreaking shift in how public companies approach treasury management, with Bitcoin at the center.‚Äù Disclosure: Nakamoto is in partnership with Bitcoin Magazine‚Äôs parent company BTC Inc to build the first global network of Bitcoin treasury companies, where BTC Inc provides certain marketing services to Nakamoto.

      <title>Telegram launches non-custodial crypto app in USMessaging app Telegram has launched a new non-custodial crypto wallet in the United States through a partnership with MoonPay. The new feature will enable millions of users to send and manage crypto directly within the app.

Telegram previously launched a crypto wallet globally that was activated by more than 100 million users. Tuesday‚Äôs launch will enable users in the U.S. to send, receive, and manage cryptocurrency directly inside the app.

The wallet is built on The Open Platform, a.k.a. TOP, which is built on the TON blockchain. The feature allows users to transact with crypto as easily as sending a message. Telegram said that the wallet will be instantly installed and will not require a download.

The Open Platform recently raised a $28.5 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation.

Telegram infamously fought the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in court after launching its TON token in 2019. After a protracted legal battle, Telegram agreed to return $1.2 billion to investors and pay an $18.5 million penalty to settle with the SEC.</title>

      <title>DevvStream pivots, anchors crypto treasury to BTC and SOLNasdaq-listed carbon management firm DevvStream unveiled Tuesday the initial composition of its digital asset treasury, naming Bitcoin, Solana and its own DevvE token as core holdings. The company also appointed BitGo as its qualified custodian and brought in FRNT Financial as a digital asset advisor, signaling a deliberate move to pair ESG mandates with programmable finance. DevvStream CEO Sunny Trinh said the company‚Äôs crypto treasury strategy is less about speculative upside and more about institutional-grade liquidity, ecosystem alignment, and real-world asset integration. ‚ÄúOur treasury model isn‚Äôt just about holding crypto. It‚Äôs about aligning capital with our mission,‚Äù Trinh said. ‚ÄúOur mix of assets is designed to deliver institutional-grade efficiency and income, while bridging to sustainability tokenization and real-world asset integration. Together, they position DevvStream at the intersection of liquidity, innovation, and impact.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC), described by the company as the ‚Äúfoundational asset of the digital economy,‚Äù serves as the bedrock of its treasury, offering deep liquidity and institutional credibility. Unlike firms that treat BTC purely as a hedge, DevvStream appears to view it as an on-ramp for broader blockchain integration, ensuring stability while it experiments with more dynamic assets. Solana‚Äôs (SOL) inclusion is equally deliberate. The company cited SOL‚Äôs transaction speed and ecosystem depth as key factors, suggesting an intent to generate yield through staking or DeFi participation. This is a departure from passive Bitcoin holdings, aligning with a growing trend of corporations leveraging proof-of-stake networks for treasury management, where idle assets can earn returns without traditional market risks. But the most unconventional pick is DevvE, the company‚Äôs proprietary token. Unlike BTC and SOL, DevvE isn‚Äôt just a store of value or yield vehicle; it‚Äôs designed to facilitate what the firm calls ‚Äúimpact-layer tokenization,‚Äù linking digital finance directly to carbon offset projects and other sustainability initiatives. The company hasn‚Äôt disclosed exact allocation percentages.</title>

      <title>Wall Street is Warming Up to Rate Cuts‚ÄîWill Crypto Be the Biggest Winner?Wall Street is increasingly betting on US interest rate cuts before the end of 2025. At the same time, political pressure from Donald Trump has intensified, as he becomes more vocally aggressive toward Powell for rate cuts. ¬†With inflation cooling and markets adjusting expectations, crypto could stand to gain the most from a looser monetary policy. Trump Wants Fed to Bring Interest Rate Down to 1% Earlier today, Trump renewed his attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He called for a 3 percentage point rate cut and claimed it would save the US economy $1 trillion annually.¬† The US President also accused Powell of keeping rates high for ‚Äúpolitical reasons.‚Äù While the Fed has held rates steady at 4.25%‚Äì4.50% since June, speculation is rising. Goldman Sachs now expects the first cut to arrive in September.¬† Meanwhile, traders on prediction market Kalshi see a 40% chance of two cuts before year-end. This shift follows a steep drop in US inflation expectations . One-year consumer expectations fell to 4.4% in July, the lowest since February.¬†That marks a 2.2 percentage point drop over just two months‚Äîone of the largest two-month declines in history. Longer-term inflation expectations are also easing. Five-year outlooks dropped 0.8 percentage points in the last quarter, now sitting at 3.6%.¬† Overall, these trends suggest the Fed has more room to ease without sparking fears of a price spiral. The crypto market is paying close attention. Bitcoin remains above $118,000 , while Ethereum holds near $3,700. Both assets have historically rallied after Fed rate cuts, benefiting from increased liquidity and investor risk appetite. Could a Major Crypto Bull Run Begin? Historically, rate cuts have kicked off strong crypto bull markets .¬† After the Fed slashed rates in March 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, Bitcoin soared from under $10,000 to over $60,000 within a year. Ethereum followed, supported by DeFi and NFT growth. If a new rate cut cycle begins in September, it could bring similar conditions. Lower yields push investors toward risk-on assets, including crypto.¬† Capital could also rotate from bonds and cash into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and high-conviction altcoins. Additionally, falling inflation expectations and improving regulatory clarity‚Äîsuch as the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts ‚Äîmay reinforce investor confidence.¬† This convergence of macro and policy signals could extend the current cycle beyond previous all-time highs. However, timing matters. Crypto is already near record levels, so momentum may depend on how fast and deep the cuts are. A delayed or shallow response from the Fed could limit upside. Key Dates to Watch The next Federal Reserve policy meeting will take place on July 29‚Äì30 . While markets expect no change, Fed commentary will be closely parsed for signals about September. The next critical date is September 16‚Äì17 , when the FOMC reconvenes. This is widely seen as the first realistic window for a rate cut, especially if inflation continues to decline. Other key indicators to monitor: For crypto traders, these dates offer cues for potential market inflection points. A confirmed Fed pivot could trigger renewed buying pressure, particularly in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and high-liquidity altcoins.</title>

      <title>Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers file amendments for in-kind redemptions, signaling &apos;positive movement&apos; with SECSeveral ETF issuers filed amendments with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to permit in-kind creations and redemptions from their spot crypto funds, something one expert says indicates that there is positive momentum going on at the agency.

21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Galaxy, VanEck, and WisdomTree all submitted their amended proposals Tuesday morning seeking to make their spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, as well as future crypto ETFs, more efficient.

&quot;More positive signs,&quot; Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a post on X .&quot;This indicates to me that there is positive movement and likely fine tuning happening with the SEC.&quot;

These firms have been seeking in-kind redemptions for months, and SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said last month that in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs are &quot;on the horizon.&quot;

&quot;Those (forms) are going through the process now,&quot; Peirce said on June 25. &quot;So I think that&apos;s something that&apos;s certainly on the horizon at some point. I can&apos;t prejudge, but we hear that there&apos;s a lot of interest.&quot;

Seyffart clarified that this would only be for the &quot;authorized participants&quot; like major Wall Street firms and market makers ‚Äî not retail traders ‚Äî to trade in shares of their ETFs for the underlying asset.

&quot;[T]he vast majority of people won&apos;t even see a difference because the products on the market now already trade extremely efficiently,&quot; Seyffart said. &quot;This will treat crypto ETPs the same as other ETPs are treated.

Crypto ETF &quot;floodgates&quot; are poised to open as the SEC is also weighing a faster approval framework, The Block&apos;s Sarah Wynn previously reported. Following spot BTC ETFs (January 2024) and spot ETH ETFs (July 2024), there are now several dozen more crypto-related ETFs seeking approval. [The Block]</title>

      <title>Justin Sun to Become Youngest Chinese Commercial Astronaut with Blue Origin‚Äôs New ShepardGeneva, Switzerland - July 22, 2025 - Justin Sun, founder of TRON and one of the most recognizable figures in crypto, is set to make history as the youngest Chinese-born commercial astronaut and the first Forbes-cover crypto entrepreneur to travel to space aboard Blue Origin‚Äôs New Shepard. This mission is the 14th human flight for the New Shepard program and the 34th in its history. The flight date will be announced soon. The live webcast on launch day will start 30 minutes before liftoff.

In 2021, Sun placed the winning bid for the first seat on New Shepard. The $28 million in proceeds were donated to Blue Origin‚Äôs foundation, Club for the Future, which selected 19 space-focused non-profits to each receive a $1 million grant to inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) for the benefit of Earth and help invent the future of life in space.

‚ÄúWe are witnessing the beginning of a new chapter in human exploration, where space is no longer reserved for governments or institutions but is becoming a frontier for innovators, dreamers, and builders from all walks of life,‚Äù said Sun. ‚ÄúBlue Origin‚Äôs commitment to expanding access to space, along with Club for the Future‚Äôs mission to inspire young people worldwide, reflects a powerful vision. I am proud to support this effort and help advance the belief that space is a place for everyone, not just a select few.‚Äù

Sun‚Äôs upcoming flight is more than a personal milestone. It highlights the growing international presence in commercial space travel and the increasing connection between blockchain and scientific innovation. As a leading voice in the digital economy and a strong advocate for decentralized technology, his journey reflects the broader potential for global collaboration and progress at the frontier of space exploration.

      <title>What is Zohran Mamdani‚Äôs Crypto Position Ahead of the New York Mayoral Election?New York‚Äôs viral mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has caused a social media storm with his ‚Äòsocial democratic‚Äô political ideology and engaging campaign approach. However, his crypto stance still remains in the grey. Meanwhile, Mamdani‚Äôs opposition is already turning to the crypto industry to swing public opinion. Zohran Mamdani‚Äôs Silence on Crypto New York City, a major cryptocurrency industry hub, is scheduled to hold a mayoral election on November 4, 2025. Current Mayor Eric Adams, elected as a Democrat, is seeking re-election as an independent candidate. Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York State, is also running. The two men, who formerly ran for offices on Democratic party tickets, are up against a rising newcomer in the NYC mayoral race. That would be 33-year-old New York assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who is running as a Democrat, winning the party‚Äôs nomination over Cuomo, who now plans to run as an independent. Already, Mamdani is quite popular, even to those outside of New York‚Äôs five boroughs. On July 16, Mamdani was in Washington. He was meeting with leading Democrats such as Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who both endorsed Mamdani in his party‚Äôs successful primary run against Cuomo. Sanders posted on Twitter/X on that day about Mamdami, saying he was ‚Äúdeeply impressed by the grassroots campaign he is running‚Äù. But Mamdani has never talked about crypto. BeInCrypto reached out to Mamdani, both his campaign and council office, for comments on the blockchain industry. There was no response as of press time. Though his following is largely a younger demographic, he hasn‚Äôt yet addressed policy regarding blockchain and cryptocurrency in a city well-known for the industry. Some in crypto might be concerned. Leading Democrats have been critical of cryptocurrency, mainly due to consumer protection issues. Will Mamdani‚Äôs Political Ideology Hamper New York‚Äôs Crypto Progress? The most outspoken Democrat member of the crypto opposition is Elizabeth Warren, who told CNBC on July 17 that Mamdani is ‚Äúwilling to try new ideas‚Äù. That might not be enough to convince cryptocurrency advocates Mamdani is the right person to push blockchain technology forward in NYC, where companies like Uniswap, OpenSea and ConsenSys are headquartered. ‚ÄúNot bullish,‚Äù said Brian Mahoney, based in NYC as vice president of business development for Thesis, a Bitcoin startup accelerator. Influential Democrats like Warren have been outspoken critics of the cryptocurrency industry. And Mamdani‚Äôs position as a ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù Democrat may not align with the free market ideals of blockchain and cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs hard to tell when Mamdani‚Äôs positioning is not yet clear. It may take some time before that positioning crystallizes ahead of the election in November. Many cryptocurrency companies that would rather have less regulation, especially in light of New York State‚Äôs onerous BitLicense requirements, could be concerned if Mamdani starts to criticize the industry. Yet the majority of crypto companies concerned about tougher regulations in New York may have some fear of a very left-leaning mayoral candidate like Mamdani. This is largely because Mamdani plans to make busing in NYC free and freeze rents for citizens. Already, opponent and incumbent Eric Adams is busy courting cryptocurrency, seeing it as an opportunity for fundraising. Empower NYC, a super PAC, is raising up to $10 million for Adams, largely from the crypto and banking industry. It will be interesting to see what Mamdani‚Äôs views and positioning will be about crypto. To him, is it a world-changing good for the people? Or does he view it as harmful for the people of New York City, despite it being an industry epicenter? Only time and Mamdani‚Äôs positioning will truly tell. [BeInCrypto]</title>
