      <title>Analysis: Ethereum&apos;s rise driven by ETFs and corporate funds, with supply-demand imbalance as the main reasonAccording to Bitwise analysis, since May 15, ETFs and corporate treasuries have purchased approximately 2.83M ETH, far exceeding the newly generated output during the same period, with a supply-demand ratio as high as 32:1. CIO Matt Hougan pointed out that this round of increase is mainly driven by structural capital inflows, rather than emotional factors. He expects that the net purchase volume of ETH may reach $2.00B in the next year, continuing to push up prices. (The Block) [Odaily]</title>

      <title>How Russia is using Kyrgyzstan’s crypto market to bypass sanctions: reportHas Russia turned Kyrgyzstan’s booming crypto market into a backdoor for moving funds? A new report sheds light on how Kyrgyz-registered exchanges are helping Russian networks evade sanctions. According to TRM Labs, Kyrgyzstan’s crypto industry has exploded from near-zero to billions in activity since passing its “On Virtual Assets” law back in 2022. By October 2024, authorities had issued 126 virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses, with licensed platforms recording $4.2 billion in transactions in the first seven months of 2024 alone. But with the region’s relatively weak oversight on the local industry, the rapid growth has made it an attractive base for entities seeking to bypass sanctions. TRM Labs’ report points to crypto exchanges Grinex and Meer, which sprang up in Kyrgyzstan shortly after U.S. law enforcement disrupted Russia’s Garantex in March 2025. On-chain analysis suggests both firms, suspected to be successors, used similar wallet infrastructure and transaction patterns as Garantex, helping Russian users move funds through A7A5, a Russian ruble-tied stablecoin that has long come under scrutiny. Crypto.news reported earlier in June that an FT research revealed that the A7A5 stablecoin has quietly moved billions since launch, and has ties to sanctioned entities that suggest it may be part of broader efforts to bypass Western sanctions and enable cross-border payments for Russian entities. Another exchange, Envoys Vision Digital Exchange (EVDE), was found to have ties to wallets linked to the Rusich Group, a sanctioned Russian paramilitary organization. Many of these platforms also display signs of being shell companies, including identical registration addresses, shared founders, and recycled contact information, suggesting coordinated or shared illicit control. TRM Labs warns that while Kyrgyzstan may be exploited rather than complicit, weak oversight leaves the door wide open. Without tighter controls on VASP registrations, clearer ownership rules, and stronger checks on shell companies, Russia’s financial networks will keep exploiting the country’s crypto infrastructure. If left unaddressed, similar tactics could also spread to neighboring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which are already rolling out crypto-friendly regulations, undermining international sanctions.

The Fed&apos;s tariff analysis is &quot;a little wrong&quot;. (Talking about interest rate decisions) I don&apos;t know what the Fed is thinking. The review of the Federal Reserve may be to set up a committee. The Bank of England has done a good job in reviewing its past monetary policy. The frustration of the Fed&apos;s mission puts monetary policy independence at risk. Trump has said that he will not fire Powell. Economist El-Erian said that Powell should resign, which is a bit surprising. My regular talks with Federal Reserve Chairman Powell are still continuing. (Talking about Bowman as a candidate for Federal Reserve Chairman) Reluctant to reveal the name of the candidate. Powell has not yet indicated that he will leave his position on the board. Since the global financial crisis, regulation has been too strict. Trump always has a plan, it&apos;s just not always obvious. Trump has created the biggest negotiating leverage on tariffs. The selection of a successor to Governor Kugler is being carried out simultaneously. US Treasury Secretary Bessant (talking about Trump&apos;s tariff plan) The market reaction was relatively calm. U.S. Treasury Secretary Benson also said that he believes regional banks are strong contenders for the Federal Reserve chairmanship. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Stellar (XLM) Risks a 40% Drop as Bearish Divergence ReturnsStellar’s (XLM) price trades near $0.47 after a 103% month-on-month. The rally has stalled into small daily candles (mostly indecisive Doji candles) . And two daily signals now lean lower: a heavy block of leveraged longs sits under price, and slipping momentum. Key support levels might be at risk. Leverage Pocket Below $0.40 Raises Cascade Risk Price is hovering above $0.45, but Bitget’s 30‑day XLM/USDT liquidation map shows roughly $79.8 million of long exposure compared with about $42.1 million in shorts , with the cumulative cluster highlighted under $0.40. Each step down would trigger smaller pockets first, then the dense area under $0.40 can amplify selling as forced closures hit the order book. A liquidation map plots where leveraged positions get auto-closed; when the largest clusters sit below spot, even a modest drop can snowball. Daily RSI Divergence Mirrors December Slide Since July 14, the price has held near the highs while the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) on the daily chart has made lower highs. The last time XLM showed this pattern, in late December, the price fell over 40%. RSI measures the strength of recent price movements on a 0–100 scale. When price is steady or rising but RSI eases, momentum is not confirming the move, and pullback risk increases. With leverage and liquidation risks waiting below, that loss of momentum becomes more dangerous, supporting the “ XLM price correction ” logic. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter  here . XLM Price Now Eyes Key Support Levels A Fibonacci retracement drawn from the $0.21 low to the $0.52 high frames the likely supports if selling starts: $0.44 (0.236) being the strongest level will multiple support hits. Fibonacci levels mark common pullback areas, and when they overlap with liquidation clusters, reactions tend to be sharper. XLM is currently sitting above $0.44. A daily close beneath that level would put $0.40 in focus. Below $0.40, the liquidation hypothesis wins, so a break there could speed a move toward $0.33. A 40% decline (inspired by the December 2024 pattern) from the $0.52 high lands under $0.33. Under $0.28 (if the $0.33 level breaks), the entire XLM price structure could turn bearish in the short term. Invalidation is straightforward: a firm daily close back above $0.52, with RSI turning up and liquidation risk thinning out, would neutralize this bearish setup and restore the upside case.</title>

      <title>Approximately $1.9 billion USD worth of ETH is queuing to exit the Ethereum PoS network, while approximately $1.3 billion USD worth of ETH is queuing to join.Data shows that the Ethereum validator exit queue has surged in the past week, with approximately 521,000 ETH (worth approximately $1.9 billion at current prices) waiting to exit the Ethereum network. The number of ETH requested to exit has increased significantly since July 16, and the exit waiting time has been extended to 8 to 9 days, the longest waiting time since the beginning of 2024. At the same time, more than 359,500 ETH are queued to join the network, worth approximately $1.3 billion, with an expected activation delay of approximately 6 days. This situation reflects two opposing forces in the market: on the one hand, some stakers may be choosing to take profits after Ethereum rebounded 162.00% from its April low, leading to a surge in the exit queue; on the other hand, new deposits driven by regulatory benefits and institutional demand are also pushing up the entry queue, such as listed companies like SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion increasing their ETH holdings and staking.

      <title>Security agency: A BSC unverified contract was attacked, with losses exceeding $600,000.On July 23, blockchain security agency BlockSec Phalcon issued a warning that its system detected a series of malicious transactions against an unverified contract (0x16d7c6f43df19778e382b7a84bcb8c763971a551) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), causing losses of more than $600,000. Since the contract is not open source, investigations show that the vulnerability stems from the lack of slippage protection, and the attacker used a fake liquidity pool to harvest TA tokens (0x539ae81a166e5e80aed211731563e549c411b140) and sold them in a legitimate pool for profit. BlockSec Phalcon strongly recommends that users who have authorized the contract immediately revoke permissions to prevent further losses. [PANews]</title>

      <title>EU prepares 100 billion euro &quot;no deal&quot; plan to deal with 30% US tariffsJuly 23 news, according to foreign media reports, if the negotiations break down and US President Trump fulfills his threat to impose a 30% tariff on most EU exports after August 1, the EU plans to quickly impose a 30% tariff on US products worth about 100.00 billion euros (about 117.00 billion US dollars). A spokesman for the European Commission said on Wednesday that as part of the first wave of countermeasures, the EU will combine the already approved tariff list for 21.00 billion euros of US goods and the previously proposed tariff list for another 72.00 billion euros of US products into a package. According to people familiar with the matter, US exports, including Boeing aircraft, US-made cars and industrial products such as bourbon whiskey, will face tariffs matching Trump&apos;s threat of 30%. These people said that the tariffs will be ready to take effect next month, but only if the negotiations break down and the United States implements its tax measures after the August deadline. An unnamed government official said that in the absence of an agreement, Berlin is even willing to support the activation of the EU&apos;s &quot;anti-coercion tool&quot; (ACI). This tool will only be activated if an agreement cannot be reached. [PANews]</title>
