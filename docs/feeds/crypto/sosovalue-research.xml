      <title>Bifrost Launches $3.00M Multi-Chain Liquidity Incentive to Drive Polkadot DeFi into a Multi-Chain EcosystemOn July 24th, to open up asset channels between Polkadot and the mainstream multi-chain ecosystem, vDOT/ETH and vDOT/BNB liquidity pools will be officially launched on Uniswap V4 on July 25th, and a 12-month liquidity incentive program with a total of 795,000 DOT incentives will be launched simultaneously. This integration provides DOT with a stable and sustainable liquidity entry point into the Ethereum ecosystem, expanding its actual usability in mainstream DeFi networks. As part of the DeFi Singularity program, the first round of incentives now covers Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, and the Ethereum mainnet, and liquidity rewards are simultaneously launched around the vDOT/ETH and DOT/ETH pools. Users can participate in liquidity provision through Uniswap V4 and receive incentives in real-time on the Merkl platform. vDOT is a DOT liquid staking token launched by Bifrost, and currently has a cumulative staked TVL of over $74,000,000.00, widely used in governance, lending, DEX and other scenarios. This round of incentives is seen as an important step in promoting vDOT to become a multi-chain yield-bearing asset, and also brings higher liquidity and DeFi integration potential to DOT.

According to the agreement, 90% of tariff items exported by the UK to India will be reduced, of which 85% will be completely duty-free within ten years; 99% of tariff items exported by India to the UK will also be reduced. The agreement is expected to increase the output of the UK economy by 4.8 billion pounds per year and bring long-term trade growth to the two countries. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Solana devs eye 66% block limit increase to 100M compute units to further boost network capacitySolana core developers have published a new improvement document, SIMD-0286, that would increase the network’s per-block compute limit from 60 million to 100 million compute units, a 66% boost aimed at delivering more throughput for decentralized finance users and builders, according to the Solana Foundation’s GitHub proposal.

Block limits define the amount of computational work that validators can process within each 400-millisecond block. Bigger ceilings allow high-intensity programs, such as order-book DEXs and MEV auctioneers, to run without encountering “compute budget exceeded” errors, although they also require validators to handle heavier loads.

The network last raised block limits on July 23 through the activation of SIMD 0256, which raised capacity to 60 million CUs, helping Solana process roughly 1,700 transactions per second in daytime traffic. But developer demand for more headroom has grown as restaking protocols, NFT mints, and DePIN projects crowd block space. The change, currently being discussed and tested, would take effect in an upcoming software release and activate automatically at a future epoch once validators upgrade and agree to the higher ceiling.

Solana’s SIMD‑0286 proposal arrives as rival chains shell out their own upgrades. Ethereum’s Pectra hard fork improved the utility of ephemeral data blobs for roll‑ups introduced in the Dencun update. The Bitcoin community is exploring the OP_CAT opcode for smart contract extensions, such as covenants, and better scripting, a move that could greenlight more programmable operations on the network.</title>

      <title>67% of Gen Z Crypto Traders Use AI to Manage Volatility, MEXC Study ShowsA recent behavioral study from MEXC Research reveals a dramatic generational shift in crypto trading. According to in-platform analytics of over 780,000 users, 67% of Gen Z traders (ages 18–27) already use or actively adopt AI-powered tools. This cohort is embracing automation for purposes beyond convenience, to manage risk, reduce emotional bias, and delegate strategic decisions in volatile market conditions. AI Adoption Soars Among Gen Z Traders on MEXC MEXC’s Q2 2025 behavioral intelligence report shows that two-thirds of Gen Z users activated at least one AI bot or rule-based strategy in the last 90 days. However, usage goes deeper than bot deployment. These users actively incorporate AI into their trading behaviors, with 22.1% engaging with AI tools at least four times a month. Based on the report, Gen Z now accounts for 60% of all AI bot activations on the platform. This cohort averages 11.4 days per month interacting with AI tools, which is more than twice the engagement of users over 30. Their usage is also intentional, with the study showing 73% of Gen Z traders activate bots during volatility spikes but shut them off during low-volume or sideways markets. For them, AI is not a blanket solution. Rather, it is a selective, situational advantage. Emotional Regulation and Delegation: The Gen Z Edge MEXC Research’s findings suggest that, beyond trusting AI, Gen Z uses it as a psychological buffer. Traders using bots saw a 47% reduction in panic sell-offs during market stress, compared to those trading manually. Rather than reacting to every market twitch, Gen Z configures automated strategies with clear rules, then steps back. This method, described in the report as “structured delegation,” reduces decision fatigue and cognitive overload and mirrors broader digital behaviors in the workplace. According to a May 2025 survey by Resume.org, over 50% of Gen Z workers view ChatGPT as a co-worker or “friend.” AI is going beyond replacing human judgment to enhance emotional discipline for these users. Risk Management Reimagined The shift toward AI is also transforming how risk is managed. Gen Z users who engage with AI trading tools are: These patterns reflect a new style of semi-automated trading, where bots act as fail-safes in moments of high emotion or uncertainty . AI is going beyond accelerating trades, enforcing discipline when it matters most. Gen Z vs Millennials: Two Trading Operating Systems Further, MEXC’s cross-generational analysis reveals a fundamental divergence in trading psychology . On the one hand, millennials lean toward structured, thesis-driven approaches that heavily use charts, research, and manual oversight. On the other hand, Gen Z approaches trading like they use Discord or TikTok — rapid, reactive, and interface-dependent. Rather than long-form strategies, Gen Z favors modular, customizable tools that allow for flexible control. Their trading activity is shaped by emotional bandwidth and attention cycles. They toggle automation on and off based on market mood and personal stress levels, a behavior foreign to the older cohort’s more static strategies. This reflects broader patterns in copy trading , influencer-led decision-making, and social-driven investment communities. This report suggests that Gen Z is already building the future of crypto trading rather than waiting for it. However, in their pursuit of prioritizing speed, clarity, and emotional control, users must also be wary of blind trust. Overreliance on AI tools can introduce new risks, including algorithmic bias, flawed datasets, and model opacity, posing systemic threats. [MEXC Research]</title>

      <title>Forbes: Cryptocurrency tax treatment remains unchanged after new US billReported on July 24 that, according to Forbes, despite the recent passage of the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act in the Senate, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) still regards cryptocurrencies as &quot;intangible property&quot; for taxation, and the relevant tax regulations have not changed substantially for investors and traders. The GENIUS Act strengthens the compliance requirements for stablecoin issuers, but does not affect the tax classification of crypto assets. The CLARITY Act proposes a regulatory framework for digital asset securities and commodities, but also does not change the existing position of the IRS. Experts pointed out that currently cryptocurrency transactions do not need to comply with the wash sale rules of securities, and investors can flexibly carry forward losses, but they cannot enjoy the preferential tax treatment of some securities or commodity transactions. Unless the U.S. tax law is further revised, cryptocurrencies will still be taxed as property. [PANews]</title>
