      <title>Analysis of the reasons for the batch unstaking of 620,000 ETH: Aave interest rate surge triggers deleveragingOn July 23, according to Aunt Ai, in response to the recent concentrated unstaking of 620,000 ETH, blogger @0xdoge_bull inferred that Aave ETH deposits were withdrawn in large quantities in a short period of time, causing borrowing interest rates to soar, and revolving loan players turned from earning interest rate spreads to losses, and were forced to redeem stETH to deleverage, which ultimately led to this large-scale unstaking. In terms of data, Aave ETH borrowing APR once soared to 10%, Lido&apos;s stETH withdrawal waiting period was also extended to 21 days, and the on-chain stETH exchange for ETH showed a discount of nearly 0.4%.

      <title>Analysis: Ethereum&apos;s rise driven by ETFs and corporate funds, with supply-demand imbalance as the main reasonAccording to Bitwise analysis, since May 15, ETFs and corporate treasuries have purchased approximately 2.83M ETH, far exceeding the newly generated output during the same period, with a supply-demand ratio as high as 32:1. CIO Matt Hougan pointed out that this round of increase is mainly driven by structural capital inflows, rather than emotional factors. He expects that the net purchase volume of ETH may reach $2.00B in the next year, continuing to push up prices. (The Block) [Odaily]</title>

      <title>How Russia is using Kyrgyzstan’s crypto market to bypass sanctions: reportHas Russia turned Kyrgyzstan’s booming crypto market into a backdoor for moving funds? A new report sheds light on how Kyrgyz-registered exchanges are helping Russian networks evade sanctions. According to TRM Labs, Kyrgyzstan’s crypto industry has exploded from near-zero to billions in activity since passing its “On Virtual Assets” law back in 2022. By October 2024, authorities had issued 126 virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses, with licensed platforms recording $4.2 billion in transactions in the first seven months of 2024 alone. But with the region’s relatively weak oversight on the local industry, the rapid growth has made it an attractive base for entities seeking to bypass sanctions. TRM Labs’ report points to crypto exchanges Grinex and Meer, which sprang up in Kyrgyzstan shortly after U.S. law enforcement disrupted Russia’s Garantex in March 2025. On-chain analysis suggests both firms, suspected to be successors, used similar wallet infrastructure and transaction patterns as Garantex, helping Russian users move funds through A7A5, a Russian ruble-tied stablecoin that has long come under scrutiny. Crypto.news reported earlier in June that an FT research revealed that the A7A5 stablecoin has quietly moved billions since launch, and has ties to sanctioned entities that suggest it may be part of broader efforts to bypass Western sanctions and enable cross-border payments for Russian entities. Another exchange, Envoys Vision Digital Exchange (EVDE), was found to have ties to wallets linked to the Rusich Group, a sanctioned Russian paramilitary organization. Many of these platforms also display signs of being shell companies, including identical registration addresses, shared founders, and recycled contact information, suggesting coordinated or shared illicit control. TRM Labs warns that while Kyrgyzstan may be exploited rather than complicit, weak oversight leaves the door wide open. Without tighter controls on VASP registrations, clearer ownership rules, and stronger checks on shell companies, Russia’s financial networks will keep exploiting the country’s crypto infrastructure. If left unaddressed, similar tactics could also spread to neighboring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which are already rolling out crypto-friendly regulations, undermining international sanctions.
