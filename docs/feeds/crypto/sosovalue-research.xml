      <title>Bessant: The quality of trade agreements is more important than the timing of signingOn July 21, U.S. Treasury Secretary Benson said that trade negotiations are currently ongoing and he is more concerned about reaching a high-quality agreement rather than completing the agreement before August 1. Benson said that they are not in a hurry, but it is conceivable that the EU will want to negotiate faster, but at least the EU is now more engaged. Its current priority is to get the best deal for the United States (on the issue of Japan). Some analysts said that Benson&apos;s remarks indicate that &quot;delaying tactics&quot; are likely to appear again by August 1, so people can wait and see. At the same time, Benson said on the issue of Powell, &quot;Ultimately, this is Trump&apos;s decision on Powell.&quot; He then added that they need to look at the Federal Reserve as a whole institution.

      <title>Analyst: Ethereum is expected to reach around $8,000.00 in early 2026, with its price structure similar to the 1980s Dow Jones bull market patternOn July 21, Cointelegraph reported that analyst Gert van Lagen pointed out that Ethereum (ETH) is in the &quot;final surge&quot; stage and may move towards the $8,000.00 price level. He found that ETH&apos;s current price structure is strikingly similar to the bull market pattern of the Dow Jones Index in 1980. The analysis is based on the &quot;textbook expansion diagonal&quot; pattern, which has provided strong support for Ethereum&apos;s main rebound since mid-2022. Currently, ETH is trading between the upper and lower boundaries of this pattern, and is expected to reach the upper boundary of about $8,000.00 in early 2026. Technically, ETH has re-established a multi-year upward trend line as support and is consolidating within an ascending triangle pattern. A break above the $3,900.00-$4,150.00 level resistance zone could trigger a rise to $7,150.00, close to the target price of the trumpet pattern. Analysts say that macroeconomic factors such as the expected Fed rate cuts and continued ETH ETF inflows may support this upward trend. [Techflow]</title>
