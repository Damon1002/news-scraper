      <title>US court restarts trademark lawsuit related to Yuga Labs, rules BAYC NFT is a protectable trademarkA U.S. court has reinstated Yuga Labs&apos; trademark lawsuit against conceptual artist Ryder Ripps and developer Jeremy Cahen. The court ruled that a jury must decide whether the duo&apos;s parody NFT series misled consumers. Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano said that the court found in this appeal that Yuga&apos;s BAYC NFTs are protectable trademarks and not purely a scam, and also confirmed that NFTs can be protected as &quot;goods&quot; under the Lanham Act, rejecting arguments that NFTs are too intangible to qualify for trademark protection under U.S. law.

      <title>Hong Kong to criminalize unlicensed stablecoin promotion from AugustOn July 24, according to Cointelegraph, Hong Kong will begin to implement the Stablecoin Ordinance on August 1, 2025, prohibiting the provision or promotion of unlicensed fiat-backed stablecoins (FRS) to retail investors. Violators may be fined up to HK$50,000.00 and imprisoned for six months. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a warning on Wednesday, reminding investors to stay away from unlicensed stablecoins to avoid accidentally violating the law. HKMA President Yu Weiwen said that the new regulations are aimed at bringing credibility and stability to the stablecoin industry while protecting investors from fraud and excessive speculation. Although there are currently as many as 50 companies applying for stablecoin licenses, most applications lack practical implementation plans and only a few licenses will be approved. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Bitget Research Institute: Altseason Index Shows an Upward Trend, Funds May Rotate to Altcoins in the Short TermBitget Research Institute&apos;s chief analyst Ryan Lee stated that Bitcoin&apos;s dominance has recently fallen back to the 59%-61% range, while the altcoin season index shows an upward trend, indicating that funds are rotating towards mainstream altcoins such as Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, with related assets rising by 20%-40% recently. Ryan Lee pointed out, &quot;The active performance of sectors such as AI, RWA, and Memecoin also shows the market&apos;s strong focus on specific narratives. However, the altcoin season index has not yet broken through the 75% confirmation threshold, and the current market is more likely a phase of rotation rather than a full-blown altcoin season. To drive the market to continue into the mid-to-late third quarter, the key lies in whether Bitcoin&apos;s market share can remain below 60%. At the same time, institutional fund inflows, regulatory benefits, and improved fundamentals in the Layer 1 and DeFi sectors are all important signals to confirm the start of the altcoin season.&quot; [Odaily News]</title>

      <title>Solana developers consider increasing block limit by 66% to 100 million compute units to further increase network capacitySolana developers are considering increasing the block limit from 60 million compute units to 100 million compute units via the SIMD-0286 proposal, which would achieve a 66% capacity increase, provided validators opt-in to the upgrade. The proposal aims to further increase Solana network capacity, allowing for more transactions per second to be processed. Compute units are the basic unit of measurement for transaction complexity and resource consumption in the Solana network, and increasing the block compute unit limit will directly enhance the network&apos;s transaction processing capabilities.

      <title>Bifrost Launches $3.00M Multi-Chain Liquidity Incentive to Drive Polkadot DeFi into a Multi-Chain EcosystemOn July 24th, to open up asset channels between Polkadot and the mainstream multi-chain ecosystem, vDOT/ETH and vDOT/BNB liquidity pools will be officially launched on Uniswap V4 on July 25th, and a 12-month liquidity incentive program with a total of 795,000 DOT incentives will be launched simultaneously. This integration provides DOT with a stable and sustainable liquidity entry point into the Ethereum ecosystem, expanding its actual usability in mainstream DeFi networks. As part of the DeFi Singularity program, the first round of incentives now covers Arbitrum, Base, BNB Chain, and the Ethereum mainnet, and liquidity rewards are simultaneously launched around the vDOT/ETH and DOT/ETH pools. Users can participate in liquidity provision through Uniswap V4 and receive incentives in real-time on the Merkl platform. vDOT is a DOT liquid staking token launched by Bifrost, and currently has a cumulative staked TVL of over $74,000,000.00, widely used in governance, lending, DEX and other scenarios. This round of incentives is seen as an important step in promoting vDOT to become a multi-chain yield-bearing asset, and also brings higher liquidity and DeFi integration potential to DOT.
