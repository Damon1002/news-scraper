      <title>Justin Sun to Become Youngest Chinese Commercial Astronaut with Blue Origin’s New ShepardGeneva, Switzerland - July 22, 2025 - Justin Sun, founder of TRON and one of the most recognizable figures in crypto, is set to make history as the youngest Chinese-born commercial astronaut and the first Forbes-cover crypto entrepreneur to travel to space aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard. This mission is the 14th human flight for the New Shepard program and the 34th in its history. The flight date will be announced soon. The live webcast on launch day will start 30 minutes before liftoff.

In 2021, Sun placed the winning bid for the first seat on New Shepard. The $28 million in proceeds were donated to Blue Origin’s foundation, Club for the Future, which selected 19 space-focused non-profits to each receive a $1 million grant to inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) for the benefit of Earth and help invent the future of life in space.

“We are witnessing the beginning of a new chapter in human exploration, where space is no longer reserved for governments or institutions but is becoming a frontier for innovators, dreamers, and builders from all walks of life,” said Sun. “Blue Origin’s commitment to expanding access to space, along with Club for the Future’s mission to inspire young people worldwide, reflects a powerful vision. I am proud to support this effort and help advance the belief that space is a place for everyone, not just a select few.”

Sun’s upcoming flight is more than a personal milestone. It highlights the growing international presence in commercial space travel and the increasing connection between blockchain and scientific innovation. As a leading voice in the digital economy and a strong advocate for decentralized technology, his journey reflects the broader potential for global collaboration and progress at the frontier of space exploration.

      <title>Vitalik: The paradox of utilitarianism is that the setting of &quot;utility is infinite&quot; does not match the upper limit of human emotionsOn July 22, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote on a social media platform that the reason why many paradoxes of utilitarianism are confusing is that its &quot;unlimited utility&quot; setting conflicts with human emotional mechanisms. He pointed out that humans actually have an upper limit to their positive and negative emotional experience of a situation, so the &quot;unlimited utility&quot; assumption in theoretical models is often contrary to intuition.

      <title>US DOJ drops probe into Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell over nonprofit allegations: FortuneThe U.S. Justice Department has dropped its investigation into Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell tied to a nonprofit group, according to reporting from Fortune.

Authorities searched Powell&apos;s Los Angeles home and took electronic devices in 2023 as part of an investigation into claims he hacked and cyber-stalked a nonprofit arts group, The New York Times previously reported.

In 2023, the nonprofit alleged that Powell interfered with its computer accounts, including blocking access to emails and other messages, according to people with knowledge of the matter who spoke to The New York Times.

Powell has said he did not stalk or hack anyone and alleged that the nonprofit Verge Center for the Arts executives tried to remove him from the board, Fortune reported on Tuesday.

The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Powell told Fortune that the Federal Bureau of Investigation&apos;s raid was &quot;devastating both personally and professionally.&quot;

Powell, who co-founded the Kraken exchange, stepped down as CEO in 2022 and he is currently the chair of its board of directors.

The Justice Department&apos;s probe happened as crypto firms were being sued by federal regulators over charges related to not registering properly and fraud. A Kraken spokeswoman told the New York Times in 2023 that the investigation into Powell has nothing to do with the company and that it had no reason to believe that prosecutors were looking into other potential issues.

      <title>Fogo Launches High-Performance Layer 1 SVM Chain Public Testnet with 40 Millisecond Block TimeFogo, a Layer 1 blockchain created by former Wall Street executives, announced on Tuesday the official launch of its public testnet. Fogo aims to bring the execution speed of traditional finance to the decentralized finance space without sacrificing decentralization and composability. The team says the Fogo network can achieve 40 milliseconds block times and provide unique advantages for on-chain trading products through native infrastructure and vertical integration. Other innovations include reduced MEV risk, a co-located node architecture for real-time transaction execution, and an enhanced session-based account management experience. Fogo plans to be the first to fully deploy the Firedancer validator client, and has already adopted the Frankendancer hybrid client and will gradually transition to Firedancer.

      <title>Goldman Sachs: Expects the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady next week and begin cutting rates at the remaining three meetings in 2025.Goldman Sachs expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady next week and begin cutting rates at the remaining three meetings in 2025, as a slowing job market puts pressure on policymakers. Private sector hiring is now close to &quot;stall speed,&quot; with the risk of further slowdowns; meanwhile, consumer spending has stalled for six consecutive months, a situation extremely rare outside of recessions. Goldman Sachs also expects the Fed to cut rates twice more in early 2026. (Golden Ten) [Odaily News]</title>

      <title>PNC strikes deal with Coinbase to bring cryptocurrency services to banking customersPNC Bank said it has struck a partnership with Coinbase to let clients access cryptocurrencies through Coinbase’s Crypto‑as‑a‑Service platform, while PNC will provide select banking services to the exchange.

The companies framed the deal as a way to marry PNC’s compliance and distribution footprint with Coinbase’s institutional‑grade trading and custody stack.

&quot;Partnering with Coinbase accelerates our ability to bring innovative, crypto financial solutions to our clients,&quot; PNC Chairman and CEO William S. Demchak said in the announcement. Coinbase Institutional head Brett Tejpaul added that the CaaS toolkit will let the bank set up a scalable, security‑first crypto offering for PNC&apos;s 12 million customers.

The firms did not disclose any financial terms or a launch date for the offering.

The move lands as Wall Street banks edge deeper into digital assets. Standard Chartered recently launched spot bitcoin and ether trading for institutional clients. JPMorgan told clients that regulators outside the United States appear to prefer tokenized bank deposits — onchain versions of traditional balances that always settle at par — over privately issued stablecoins. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon nevertheless said last week the bank &quot;will be involved&quot; with both deposit tokens and stablecoins to stay competitive, even as he questioned why anyone would use a stablecoin instead of a standard payment rail.

Meanwhile, the U.S. under President Donald Trump&apos;s pro-crypto administration has accelerated supportive legislation for the blockchain-powered industry. Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act into law, standardizing rules for a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin industry with over $250 billion in circulation, according to The Block&apos;s data dashboard.

Senate Republicans also released a discussion draft on the crypto market structure, which they say expands on the Clarity bill passed in the House of Representatives last week. [The Block]</title>

      <title>Deutsche Bank: Tariff costs are borne by Americans themselves, and the dollar faces downward pressureDeutsche Bank analyst George Saravelos wrote that the dollar is facing downward pressure as Americans bear the brunt of tariff costs. Saravelos noted that if tariff costs were borne by foreign countries, their selling prices should fall, but this trend has not emerged except in individual cases. However, he also said that since U.S. inflation is still under control, it is not consumers who mainly bear the tariff costs, but importers. Saravelos said, &quot;Since tariff costs are mainly borne by the United States, this is another negative factor for the dollar.&quot; (Golden Ten) [Odaily News]</title>
