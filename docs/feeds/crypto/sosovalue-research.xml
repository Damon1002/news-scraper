      <title>FTX Hearing: Creditors in restricted jurisdictions may choose to transfer their claims to non-restricted jurisdictions for claimsOn July 23, FTX Historian, an account that tracks FTX&apos;s bankruptcy and compensation, summarized the key points of last night&apos;s hearing: Previously, if a creditor was in a &quot;restricted jurisdiction&quot; (such as China or Russia), his funds would be immediately confiscated according to the initial proposal of FTX&apos;s asset recovery party. Now the situation has changed, and creditors may be able to transfer their claims to non-restricted countries. The initial motion was &quot;If the creditor is in a restricted jurisdiction, his claims or compensation will be immediately confiscated&quot;, and the updated motion is expected to limit or delete this clause. Creditors can move to non-restricted areas (such as from China to Singapore and the UAE) and receive a distribution of funds, and the jurisdiction can be changed before the distribution. Affected creditors (such as those who have completed KYC in China but live in other countries) may be able to recover their funds through this, but they need to update information and seize the opportunity. In addition, the hearing reduced the risk of debt buyers, and they are likely to increase their bids. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Chairman of the National Institution for Finance and Development: Stablecoins will form a new interconnected model with fiat currenciesLi Yang, Chairman of the National Institution for Finance and Development, recently analyzed stablecoins from five perspectives at a seminar on &quot;The Development Prospects of RMB Stablecoins&quot;: He pointed out that stablecoins are not real currencies, but rather intermediary tools for payment and clearing driven by technology, which will form a new interconnected model with legal tender; he emphasized that sovereign currency is irreplaceable, and stablecoins cannot bypass exchange and the national right to issue currency; he believes that technological innovation should not challenge national monetary sovereignty, but should coordinate and evolve with central bank digital currencies and private payment systems; he suggested promoting the internationalization of the RMB, both internally and externally, exploring the development path of onshore and offshore RMB stablecoins, and establishing a fusion mechanism with digital RMB and the central bank custody system to guide stablecoins and legal tender to jointly build the future payment landscape.
