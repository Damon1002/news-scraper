      <title>Fogo launches high-performance Layer 1 SVM chain public beta network, aiming at innovation of on-chain transactionsOn July 22, according to The Block, Fogo, a Layer 1 blockchain founded by former Wall Street executives, announced on Tuesday that its public beta network was officially launched. Fogo aims to introduce the execution speed of traditional finance into the field of decentralized finance without sacrificing decentralization and composability. The team said that the Fogo network can achieve a 40-millisecond block time and provide unique advantages for on-chain trading products through native infrastructure and vertical integration. Other innovations include reducing MEV risks, co-location node architecture for real-time transaction execution, and improved session-based account management experience. Fogo plans to be the first to fully deploy the Firedancer validator client. It has currently adopted the Frankendancer hybrid client and will gradually transition to Firedancer. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Goldman Sachs: Expects the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady next week and begin cutting rates at the remaining three meetings in 2025.Goldman Sachs expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady next week and begin cutting rates at the remaining three meetings in 2025, as a slowing job market puts pressure on policymakers. Private sector hiring is now close to &quot;stall speed,&quot; with the risk of further slowdowns; meanwhile, consumer spending has stalled for six consecutive months, a situation extremely rare outside of recessions. Goldman Sachs also expects the Fed to cut rates twice more in early 2026. (Golden Ten) [Odaily News]</title>

      <title>PNC strikes deal with Coinbase to bring cryptocurrency services to banking customersPNC Bank said it has struck a partnership with Coinbase to let clients access cryptocurrencies through Coinbase’s Crypto‑as‑a‑Service platform, while PNC will provide select banking services to the exchange.

The companies framed the deal as a way to marry PNC’s compliance and distribution footprint with Coinbase’s institutional‑grade trading and custody stack.

&quot;Partnering with Coinbase accelerates our ability to bring innovative, crypto financial solutions to our clients,&quot; PNC Chairman and CEO William S. Demchak said in the announcement. Coinbase Institutional head Brett Tejpaul added that the CaaS toolkit will let the bank set up a scalable, security‑first crypto offering for PNC&apos;s 12 million customers.

The firms did not disclose any financial terms or a launch date for the offering.

The move lands as Wall Street banks edge deeper into digital assets. Standard Chartered recently launched spot bitcoin and ether trading for institutional clients. JPMorgan told clients that regulators outside the United States appear to prefer tokenized bank deposits — onchain versions of traditional balances that always settle at par — over privately issued stablecoins. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon nevertheless said last week the bank &quot;will be involved&quot; with both deposit tokens and stablecoins to stay competitive, even as he questioned why anyone would use a stablecoin instead of a standard payment rail.

Meanwhile, the U.S. under President Donald Trump&apos;s pro-crypto administration has accelerated supportive legislation for the blockchain-powered industry. Trump recently signed the GENIUS Act into law, standardizing rules for a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin industry with over $250 billion in circulation, according to The Block&apos;s data dashboard.

Senate Republicans also released a discussion draft on the crypto market structure, which they say expands on the Clarity bill passed in the House of Representatives last week. [The Block]</title>

      <title>Deutsche Bank: Tariff costs are borne by Americans themselves, and the dollar faces downward pressureDeutsche Bank analyst George Saravelos wrote that the dollar is facing downward pressure as Americans bear the brunt of tariff costs. Saravelos noted that if tariff costs were borne by foreign countries, their selling prices should fall, but this trend has not emerged except in individual cases. However, he also said that since U.S. inflation is still under control, it is not consumers who mainly bear the tariff costs, but importers. Saravelos said, &quot;Since tariff costs are mainly borne by the United States, this is another negative factor for the dollar.&quot; (Golden Ten) [Odaily News]</title>

      <title>$1 Trillion Capital Is All It Takes for Bitcoin to Hit $1 Million | US Crypto NewsWelcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab your coffee and settle in because the numbers behind Bitcoin’s future are starting to get serious. As global liquidity surges and the pace of money creation accelerates, some investors believe we are entering a new phase for the pioneer crypto. Crypto News of the Day: Bitcoin Hitting $1 Million Seen as Inevitable with Global Money Supply Set to Double In a recent US Crypto News publication, Davinci Jeremie urged viewers to spend just a dollar to buy Bitcoin. According to the Bitcoin maxi, BTC price could reach $500,000 per coin before 2030. Now, a growing number of analysts believe Bitcoin could go well beyond $500,000, ultimately reaching $1 million. This, they say, may be inevitable. Analysts point to a macroeconomic backdrop that heavily favors Bitcoin, citing surging global liquidity and the money supply, which is on track to double in the next decade. The sentiment echoes broader concerns about monetary debasement, especially as global central banks maintain loose fiscal policies and governments continue large-scale deficit spending. In the past year, the money supply has grown at its fastest pace in recent history, adding credence to the Bitcoin bull case. According to River, a Bitcoin-focused platform, anyone who has held Bitcoin since July 2024 has outperformed against money debasement tenfold. That outperformance reinforces Bitcoin’s positioning as a hedge against fiat dilution, particularly in an environment of rising global debt and systemic liquidity injections. Further supporting the bullish thesis, global M2 money supply per Bitcoin has reached a 12-year high. This liquidity-to-scarcity ratio reflects just how little capital is needed, in relative terms, to send Bitcoin dramatically higher. With only 21 million BTC coins ever existing, and significantly fewer in active circulation, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it increasingly responsive to institutional or sovereign capital inflows.

The self-hosted wallet supports stablecoin transfers, token exchanges, and zero-fee coin purchases through MoonPay. In 2024, more than 100.00 million users worldwide have activated the wallet, and the United States had previously postponed its launch due to regulatory uncertainty.

      <title>Wu Blockchain Daily Crypto News Roundup - Western Union Explores Integrating Stablecoin Services1. Western Union Explores Integrating Stablecoin ServicesWestern Union CEO Devin McGranahan stated that the company is exploring launching stablecoin services in its digital wallet and plans to establish cooperation channels for buying and selling stablecoins. He pointed out that stablecoins have great potential in accelerating cross-border transfers, improving the efficiency of fiat currency exchange, and providing a means of storing value for countries with unstable economies.2. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Accused of Perjury Twice, Congressman Requests Criminal ReferralU.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna submitted a criminal referral request to the Department of Justice, accusing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of twice committing perjury in testimony and written statements regarding the Fed building renovation project. The incident occurred as conservatives continue to pressure Trump to replace Powell as soon as possible, but Trump said it is currently &quot;highly unlikely&quot; to remove him from office.3. South Korea to Advance &quot;Virtual Currency Short Selling&quot; Legislation, Plans to Introduce Stock Market-Level RegulationSouth Korean financial regulators plan to introduce regulatory standards equivalent to those of the stock market for token lending services provided by the country&apos;s crypto exchanges. Currently, Bithumb offers token lending services up to 400% of the collateral value, while Upbit offers Bitcoin lending services up to 80% of the margin. Financial authorities believe that such services are essentially equivalent to short selling transactions and are considering introducing corresponding regulatory measures in the ongoing second phase of virtual asset legislation.4. Hong Kong Customs Detects HK$1.15B Money Laundering Case Involving Virtual Assets and Cash SmugglingHong Kong Customs has detected a suspected money laundering case involving approximately HK$1.15B through cash smuggling and virtual assets, arresting a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man. Customs stated that the two men are suspected of smuggling cash out of the country and frequently using funds of unknown origin to conduct large stablecoin and fiat currency transactions, with the amounts inconsistent with their financial situation. Customs raided multiple locations today, seizing items such as phones and bank cards, and arrested the two men under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance. The case is still under investigation.5. White House&apos;s First Crypto Policy Report Expected to Be Released to the Public Before the End of the MonthThe White House&apos;s first crypto policy report will be officially submitted on July 22 (local time) and is expected to be released to the public before the end of this month. White House officials have confirmed the relevant timeline. This report is the result of months of collaboration between task force leaders David Sacks, Bo Hines, and senior officials from the Treasury Department, Department of Commerce, SEC, CFTC, and other departments, aimed at implementing President Trump&apos;s January executive order on strengthening the United States&apos; leadership in the cryptocurrency field. The report is expected to include regulatory and legislative recommendations, but the specific content is not yet clear.</title>
