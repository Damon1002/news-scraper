      <title>Yi Feng Investment&apos;s proposal to acquire the Aavegotchi Treasury is opposed by the communityOn July 22, Aavegotchi community members proposed to purchase the DAO treasury (approximately 16.00M GHST) at a 60% discount to the 14-day average price, worth approximately $3.20M. The proposer, Rongming Investment, is a subsidiary of the Chinese equity financing institution Yifeng Investment. The transaction outlined in the proposal would grant Rongming Investment the right to use and market Aavegotchi IP, dissolve the DAO, and distribute the proceeds to active community members. Due to the rejection of over 90% of the community members, and with only over 2.00M GHST tokens participating, reaching only 28% of the required quorum, the acquisition offer will be rejected if the current trend remains unchanged. Voting is scheduled to end on July 25. [Foresight News]</title>

      <title>CertiK Stablecoin Report 2025: What are the top 5 most secure tokens in the stablecoin race?As stablecoin adoption grows more mainstream, so do the security risks associated with them. Which tokens are leading the race in terms of security? The first half of 2025 saw a surge in stablecoin use cases, with a monthly settlement volume rising by 43% to $1.39 trillion. According to the security firm, this rapidly increasing growth in adoption hides the widening gaps in security posture, compliance, and operational risk that still need to be addressed by the community. As a result, CertiK has managed to rank the top fiat-pegged tokens from a security and risk standpoint. The six-item Skynet rating framework assesses each token based on factors including operational resilience, governance strength, fundamental health, code security, market dynamic and community trust. According to the Skynet framework, Tether’s USDT ( USDT ) ranks at number one with an overall score of 94.72. The security firm highlighted USDT’s decision to increase its circulation from $138.00 billion to $154.00 billion in the first half of 2025. In second place is Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) with 93.37. Having secured a MiCA license and completed an IPO, Circle’s token supply increased from $41.00 billion to $61.00 billion. Although it is still slightly behind Tether, CertiK has dubbed it the “fastest growing” major stablecoin. Ranking in third place is the PayPal-Paxos jointly issued PYUSD ( PYUSD ) with a score of 91.47. The token’s market cap has doubled in the first half of 2025. Recent developments for the token include expansions into Solana ( SOL ) and Arbitrum ( ARB ) as well as a rewards program. In fourth place is USDS by Sky with 90.09. The rebranding of DAI into Sky has helped to expand the token into multiple chains. Since its launch on Solana, it has grown to become the fifth largest stablecoin. Ripple’s RLUSD ( RLUSD ) stands at number five with a Skynet framework score of 89.89. Although it still ranks below USDT and USDC in terms of supply and security mechanisms in place, CertiK noted that the token has experienced zero security incidents since its launch. Other notable tokens mentioned in the top 10 include First Digital USD ( FDUSD ), USDG by Paxos, Ethena’s USDe ( USDE ) and USDtb, as well as World Liberty Financial’s own USD1. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, as many as 344 crypto security incidents occurred in the past year. These incidents led to the theft of $2.47 billion worth of crypto assets industry-wide. Though these incidents are not always linked to stablecoins directly, they often bear the brunt of exploits, more so than regular tokens. For instance, First Digital USD saw its price plummet to $0.76 amid rumors about whether or not its reserves were secure. It was only able to recover its $1.00 value after the issuer disclosed audited holdings to prove that its reserves were safe. This case shows just how easily the cookie crumbles when it comes to stablecoins. Due to the nature of fiat-pegged tokens, its reserves are considered sacred in a way that differs to other tokens. One wrong move could result in the 1:1 ratio backed by real currencies to dip and lead to the token’s downfall. CertiK’s report showed that exploits in the crypto space, such as hacks, death spirals, and price depegs, were mostly caused by operational failures compared to technical flaws in the system. According to the study, vulnerabilities in systems where stablecoins are the primary asset made up a large portion of the losses. [CertiK]</title>

      <title>Fartcoin derivatives open interest ranks among the top ten, speculative boom emergesOn July 23, according to CoinDesk, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a meme coin of the Solana ecosystem, has now become one of the top ten tokens in terms of open interest in cryptocurrency derivatives. Data shows that the nominal open interest of Fartcoin-related futures has exceeded $1.00 billion, surpassing mainstream currencies such as Litecoin, LINK, and AVAX. It is worth noting that Fartcoin&apos;s open interest has reached 65.00% of its market value, while its market value ranks 83rd in the world. This abnormally high open interest is considered a signal of overheated market speculation. Similar phenomena are also reflected in other small-cap currencies, which may lead to large-scale investor liquidation risks. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Public Companies’ Bitcoin Bet: Can They Weather the Bear Market Storm?Public companies worldwide have been going all-in on Bitcoin (BTC) this year. Whether it’s through equity or debt issuance, firms have accelerated their push to acquire BTC and add it to their balance sheets. While Bitcoin continues to appreciate in value, the firms have also benefited through their stock surge and paper gains. But the looming question is: What will happen if a bear market returns? Will institutional confidence hold steady, or will it waver in the face of  volatility ? BeInCrypto spoke to industry experts to examine the possibilities in a potential bear market and whether these firms will contribute to more stability or downfall. Is Institutional Interest in Bitcoin a Double-Edged Sword? Over the past few months,  BeInCrypto has extensively  reported on corporate Bitcoin acquisitions. The trend pioneered by Michael Saylor, co-founder of (Micro) Strategy, has inspired many others to follow suit. Dean Chen, an analyst at Bitunix, highlighted that the growing influx of institutional capital has solidified Bitcoin’s  position as ‘digital gold.’ Furthermore, John Glover, Ledn’s Chief Information Officer (CIO), attributed Bitcoin’s reputation for stability in recent years to the increasing involvement of institutions. Glover said that with Bitcoin’s volatility decreasing over time, it is increasingly behaving like a traditional asset.  Nonetheless, as with all traditional assets, the market experiences cycles, with bull markets typically followed by bear markets. He anticipates that any future bear market for Bitcoin will likely be less severe compared to past cycles. Still, corrections are inevitable. Notably, the executive  added that while institutes bring capital,  they also bring constraints. Chen pointed out that institutional investors tend to exit faster than retail investors. Thus, if the market moves in the opposite direction, high-frequency trading funds and quant strategies are likely to sell off their positions. However, Marcin Kazmierczak, the COO and Co-Founder of Redstone, offered an alternative viewpoint. He noted that while institutional investors might encounter difficulties during bear markets, their involvement has brought  advanced risk management practices  to the cryptocurrency space.  The Success of Corporate Financing Models for Bitcoin Acquisition Institutional investors use a mix of financing  methods to buy Bitcoin , with debt being the most common one. In a post on X, Redbox Global revealed that Bitcoin-focused companies are facing a significant $12.8 billion debt maturity wall by 2028. These concerns are not new.  Previously, Sygnum Bank  and  other market analysts  have also raised alarms about the sustainability of the strategies.  Chen highlighted that Strategy raised $42.87 billion since 2020 through zero-coupon convertible notes and equity issuances to buy over 600,000 BTC at an average cost of $71,268.00. This strategy boosts Bitcoin accumulation in bull markets. Nevertheless, it strains finances in bear markets with interest payments and falling stock prices.  Moreover,  Strategy’s debt makes up about 24.3%  of its capital structure. He added that its convertible bonds may trigger mandatory conversion or redemption if Bitcoin drops below a certain threshold. Other companies like Marathon Digital issue equity before bonds, lowering the leverage. Despite this, they have higher capital costs and limited resilience. Still, Glover emphasized that companies with strong capital structures—like staggered maturities and low-interest debt—will fare better. He stated that Strategy’s model can handle significant losses. However, new firms face a higher risk of forced sales in a downturn. Anthony Georgiades, Founder and General Partner at Innovating Capital, also called the strategies a ‘high-stakes play.’ Meanwhile, Kazmierczak noted that companies using convertible debt strategies have demonstrated innovative ways to balance growth with risk management. According to him, their effectiveness ultimately depends on the strength of their core business and their ability to service debt through operational cash flows, rather than relying purely on Bitcoin appreciation.  He believes  smart treasury strategies involve appropriately sizing positions  relative to overall balance sheets. Kazmierczak detailed that many public companies holding Bitcoin have demonstrated sound management by treating BTC allocations as a part of their overall reserves. What Will Happen to Bitcoin’s Price if Institutions Start Selling? While the experts showed cautious optimism regarding the financing strategies, centralization is more concerning. As of the latest  data  from Bitcoin Treasuries, the top three publicly listed Bitcoin treasury companies collectively hold about 695,000 BTC, accounting for  3.31% of the total  BTC supply. So, what happens  when or more decide to sell?  He elaborated that hedging options are available in the space, and the liquidity of markets like  futures  and options continues to grow. Therefore, Glover hopes that BTC treasury companies are strategic in managing their risk to withstand a bear market. Nonetheless, Bitcoin isn’t the only asset that will be impacted. The decline of the largest cryptocurrency could also lead to a broader market downfall.  The CIO of Ledn stressed that  ‘Bitcoin is still the  anchor  for the entire market.’ He noted that if large holders begin offloading, it sends a message that even the ‘safe’ end of crypto isn’t secure. Factors That Could Influence Companies’ Ability to Hold Bitcoin Bitcoin and the crypto sector aren’t immune to macroeconomic pressures. Whether it’s  President Trump’s tariffs  or  the Israel-Iran conflict , the market has reacted quickly by going into a free fall. The experts also outlined factors that are most likely to influence BTC treasury companies’ ability to hold Bitcoin through a bear market. Furthermore, Bitunix’s Chen also revealed that regulatory factors could play an important role. According to him, the  Clarity Act could reduce compliance costs  for institutions, thereby supporting long-term Bitcoin holdings by treasury firms. Besides this, shareholder pressure is another key factor to consider. Chen explained that if Bitcoin crashes, coordinated shareholder actions—such as calling a special meeting—could force the board to adopt a more conservative strategy and liquidate assets to reduce risk. Despite this, Glover stresses that a potential bear market wouldn’t erase Bitcoin. However, it will serve as a crucial test for  institutional conviction in the asset . [BeInCrypto]</title>
