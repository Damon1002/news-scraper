      <title>Wu Blockchain Daily Crypto News Roundup - Western Union Explores Integrating Stablecoin Services1. Western Union Explores Integrating Stablecoin ServicesWestern Union CEO Devin McGranahan stated that the company is exploring launching stablecoin services in its digital wallet and plans to establish cooperation channels for buying and selling stablecoins. He pointed out that stablecoins have great potential in accelerating cross-border transfers, improving the efficiency of fiat currency exchange, and providing a means of storing value for countries with unstable economies.2. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Accused of Perjury Twice, Congressman Requests Criminal ReferralU.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna submitted a criminal referral request to the Department of Justice, accusing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of twice committing perjury in testimony and written statements regarding the Fed building renovation project. The incident occurred as conservatives continue to pressure Trump to replace Powell as soon as possible, but Trump said it is currently &quot;highly unlikely&quot; to remove him from office.3. South Korea to Advance &quot;Virtual Currency Short Selling&quot; Legislation, Plans to Introduce Stock Market-Level RegulationSouth Korean financial regulators plan to introduce regulatory standards equivalent to those of the stock market for token lending services provided by the country&apos;s crypto exchanges. Currently, Bithumb offers token lending services up to 400% of the collateral value, while Upbit offers Bitcoin lending services up to 80% of the margin. Financial authorities believe that such services are essentially equivalent to short selling transactions and are considering introducing corresponding regulatory measures in the ongoing second phase of virtual asset legislation.4. Hong Kong Customs Detects HK$1.15B Money Laundering Case Involving Virtual Assets and Cash SmugglingHong Kong Customs has detected a suspected money laundering case involving approximately HK$1.15B through cash smuggling and virtual assets, arresting a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man. Customs stated that the two men are suspected of smuggling cash out of the country and frequently using funds of unknown origin to conduct large stablecoin and fiat currency transactions, with the amounts inconsistent with their financial situation. Customs raided multiple locations today, seizing items such as phones and bank cards, and arrested the two men under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance. The case is still under investigation.5. White House&apos;s First Crypto Policy Report Expected to Be Released to the Public Before the End of the MonthThe White House&apos;s first crypto policy report will be officially submitted on July 22 (local time) and is expected to be released to the public before the end of this month. White House officials have confirmed the relevant timeline. This report is the result of months of collaboration between task force leaders David Sacks, Bo Hines, and senior officials from the Treasury Department, Department of Commerce, SEC, CFTC, and other departments, aimed at implementing President Trump&apos;s January executive order on strengthening the United States&apos; leadership in the cryptocurrency field. The report is expected to include regulatory and legislative recommendations, but the specific content is not yet clear.</title>

      <title>Ethereum Faces $1.3 Billion Unstaking Wave — Here’s What It Could Mean for ETHAs capital continues to flow strongly into Ethereum in 2025—pushing its price above $3,600—the amount of ETH queued for unstaking has also surged unexpectedly. What could this mean for Ethereum’s price trend? Here are some expert insights. Over 350,000 ETH Waiting to Be Unstaked—What’s the Implication? Udi Wertheimer, a prominent investor in the crypto community, raised concerns after discovering that more than 350,000 ETH—worth approximately $1.3 billion—are currently waiting in the unstaking queue. Unstaking allows users to withdraw their ETH from staking smart contracts, turning it back into freely usable assets. A large wave of unstaking could signal potential selling pressure. This is especially true if investors are looking to take profits after ETH’s 160% rally since its April lows. Earlier in 2024, more than 500,000 ETH were unstaked before ETH surged from $2,100 to over $4,000, and later dropped back to $2,100. Where Might This Unstaked ETH Go? Viktor Bunin, OG Protocol Specialist at Coinbase, suggested that this ETH might be moved into internal treasury funds. These funds could serve financial strategies like long-term investment or portfolio diversification. If that’s the case, this isn’t a sign of panic selling—it’s more likely a form of asset management. This could actually help stabilize the market in the long term. Meanwhile, a report from Lookonchain shows that on-chain data indicates around 23 whales or institutions have accumulated 681,103 ETH (worth $2.57 billion) since July 1. And the accumulation hasn’t stopped. In the fourth week of July, more institutions continued to add billions of dollars worth of ETH. What About ETH Being Staked? Udi Wertheimer’s concern may sound alarming, especially when compared to historical patterns. However, it lacks a key perspective: the amount of ETH currently waiting to be staked. Data from ValidatorQueue shows that the ETH queued for staking actually far exceeds the amount queued for unstaking. Since June, this queue has surged, with over 450,000 ETH waiting to be staked on certain days. This reflects continued investor interest in participating in the Ethereum network through staking. Data from beaconcha.in shows that over 35.7 million ETH is currently staked across various protocols. This accounts for 29.5% of the circulating supply . Ultimately, the balance between ETH entering and leaving staking protocols is a critical factor. It helps determine whether the market is facing real selling pressure or simply witnessing strategic reallocation by institutions and individual investors.</title>

      <title>Solana validator Somos Axolotl launches Web3-powered conservation in Mexico CityA nonprofit called Somos Axolotl has launched a conservation effort that taps into the Solana community. Crypto ecosystem has a long history of charitable and conservation aims. One such project, Solana (SOL) validator Somos Axolotl, has recently started a conservation initiative in Mexico City, aimed at protecting the endangered Axolotl. Centered around the historic area of Xochimilco, the project combines public sculpture, conservation, and community outreach with the crypto community. Its goal is to restore the habitat for the iconic, but endangered, Axolotl amphibian in the Xochimilco canal system. The project will also use its funds to promote regenerative agriculture for local residents and promote economic opportunity. What is more, all of the funds for the project will come from operating a Solana validator node. Supporters among Solana holders can help the project by staking their SOL with the Somos Axolotl validators. They receive staking rewards, just as with any validator, while also contributing to Axolotl conservation. Notably, Somos Axolotl is currently the only non-profit validator on the Solana blockchain. Interestingly, Solana validator nodes offer a unique opportunity for non-profit groups. Specifically, running validator nodes has high fixed costs of operation. However, once the node is set up, it is very scalable, meaning that it can service a large number of stakers. At the same time, revenues for a validator increase linearly with the amount of SOL staked with them. This means that a large validator can operate at high profit margins, while offering the same service as smaller ones. For this reason, if a validator manages to attract users through a charitable or conservation initiative, it gains a competitive edge against for-profit validators. For this reason, it is possible that more and more non-profits will join the Solana ecosystem, helping secure its network and making it more decentralized.</title>

      <title>Powell said nothing about monetary policy in his latest meeting speechFederal Reserve Chairman Powell delivered a welcome speech at a regulatory conference today, but as expected, he did not make any controversial or news-making remarks. Powell did not give any monetary policy hints in his brief pre-prepared speech, nor did he mention the pressure from the Trump administration. This is not surprising, as Federal Reserve officials are in a &quot;quiet period&quot; before the July 29-30 meeting and are not allowed to make public comments on interest rates and the economy. However, he said he welcomed comments on bank regulatory rules and capital issues. &quot;The Federal Reserve is a dynamic institution,&quot; Powell said. &quot;We are willing to listen to new ideas and feedback on how to improve the capital framework for large banks, and I look forward to hearing from today&apos;s participants.&quot; [PANews]</title>

      <title>Hong Kong Customs Detects HK$1.15 Billion Money Laundering Case Involving Virtual Assets and Cash SmugglingAccording to Sing Tao Daily, Hong Kong Customs has cracked a suspected money laundering case involving approximately HK$1.15B through cash smuggling and virtual assets, arresting a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man. Customs stated that the two are suspected of smuggling cash out of the country and frequently using funds of unknown origin to conduct large stablecoin and fiat currency transactions, with the amounts inconsistent with their financial situation. Customs raided multiple locations today, seizing items such as phones and bank cards, and arrested the two under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance. The case is still under investigation.

      <title>Bessant: There is no reason to let Powell step down as Fed chairmanOn July 22, U.S. Treasury Secretary Benson publicly supported Federal Reserve Chairman Powell amid frequent attacks from Trump administration officials, saying he saw no reason to let him step down at this time. &quot;There is no indication that he should resign now, and his term will end in May next year,&quot; Benson said in an interview with Fox Business Channel on Tuesday. &quot;If he wants to stick to it, I think he should do it. If he wants to leave early, I think he can.&quot; For months, Powell has been criticized by Trump because he led the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged, worried about the inflationary impact of the government&apos;s tariff hikes. This month, some Republicans also raised objections to Bernanke over a costly plan to renovate the Federal Reserve building. On Monday, Benson called for an internal review of the Fed&apos;s non-monetary activities, including renovation projects. &quot;There is a real opportunity for him now, and that&apos;s where his legacy lies - to rationalize the Fed&apos;s non-monetary policy functions,&quot; Benson said.
