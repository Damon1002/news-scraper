      <title>Powell said nothing about monetary policy in his latest meeting speechFederal Reserve Chairman Powell delivered a welcome speech at a regulatory conference today, but as expected, he did not make any controversial or news-making remarks. Powell did not give any monetary policy hints in his brief pre-prepared speech, nor did he mention the pressure from the Trump administration. This is not surprising, as Federal Reserve officials are in a &quot;quiet period&quot; before the July 29-30 meeting and are not allowed to make public comments on interest rates and the economy. However, he said he welcomed comments on bank regulatory rules and capital issues. &quot;The Federal Reserve is a dynamic institution,&quot; Powell said. &quot;We are willing to listen to new ideas and feedback on how to improve the capital framework for large banks, and I look forward to hearing from today&apos;s participants.&quot; [PANews]</title>

      <title>Hong Kong Customs Detects HK$1.15 Billion Money Laundering Case Involving Virtual Assets and Cash SmugglingAccording to Sing Tao Daily, Hong Kong Customs has cracked a suspected money laundering case involving approximately HK$1.15B through cash smuggling and virtual assets, arresting a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man. Customs stated that the two are suspected of smuggling cash out of the country and frequently using funds of unknown origin to conduct large stablecoin and fiat currency transactions, with the amounts inconsistent with their financial situation. Customs raided multiple locations today, seizing items such as phones and bank cards, and arrested the two under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance. The case is still under investigation.

      <title>Bessant: There is no reason to let Powell step down as Fed chairmanOn July 22, U.S. Treasury Secretary Benson publicly supported Federal Reserve Chairman Powell amid frequent attacks from Trump administration officials, saying he saw no reason to let him step down at this time. &quot;There is no indication that he should resign now, and his term will end in May next year,&quot; Benson said in an interview with Fox Business Channel on Tuesday. &quot;If he wants to stick to it, I think he should do it. If he wants to leave early, I think he can.&quot; For months, Powell has been criticized by Trump because he led the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged, worried about the inflationary impact of the government&apos;s tariff hikes. This month, some Republicans also raised objections to Bernanke over a costly plan to renovate the Federal Reserve building. On Monday, Benson called for an internal review of the Fed&apos;s non-monetary activities, including renovation projects. &quot;There is a real opportunity for him now, and that&apos;s where his legacy lies - to rationalize the Fed&apos;s non-monetary policy functions,&quot; Benson said.
