      <title>FT: JPMorgan Chase is exploring issuing loans using clients&apos; cryptocurrency as collateralJPMorgan Chase is exploring the possibility of issuing loans using clients&apos; crypto assets as collateral, another sign that one of the largest banks in the United States is pushing crypto assets into the mainstream financial system. If this policy is ultimately implemented, it would mark a major shift in the position of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who eight years ago called Bitcoin a &quot;fraud&quot; and said it would &quot;eventually implode and is only used by drug dealers and criminals.&quot; JPMorgan Chase may begin issuing loans directly using crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral as early as next year, but the plan is still subject to change.

      <title>Bank of England considers shelving digital pound plansOn July 22, foreign media reported that Bank of England officials are considering suspending plans for a digital pound for the public due to growing doubts about the benefits of the project. This reflects the fading enthusiasm for government-backed digital currencies around the world. According to people familiar with the matter, the Bank of England has privately urged the banking industry to accelerate payment innovation in order to achieve similar benefits without launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Bank of England said it still hopes to retain the ability to launch a CBDC if necessary, but if the private sector continues to launch new electronic payment technologies and its staff believe that the benefits of promoting a digital pound are declining, the central bank is willing to step back.

      <title>UBS: Stablecoins will boost net demand for short-term U.S. Treasuries, and there is still room for short-term debt supplyOn July 22, Zhitong Finance reported that UBS had previously anticipated the rapid expansion of short-term U.S. Treasury bonds in tradable debt had passed, but the GENIUS Act may bring a new round of growth. According to the Act, stablecoin issuers must maintain 100% reserve support with short-term, highly liquid, and high-quality assets. Approved reserve assets include: US dollar cash, short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, deposits of insured depository institutions, and short-term Treasury bond repurchase agreements. After the debt ceiling issue was resolved and the government&apos;s money market funds expanded significantly, the current short-term U.S. Treasury market still has ample absorption capacity. If the GENIUS Act stimulates more demand for short-term Treasury bonds, the U.S. Treasury can slightly postpone the time to expand the scale of interest-bearing Treasury bonds, and there is also more room to repurchase old bonds with poor liquidity. In any case, UBS expects the Treasury to continue to keep the relative proportion of short-term Treasury bonds to interest-bearing Treasury bonds stable. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Berachain Officially Launches PoL v2 Upgrade, Ushering in an Era of Native Yield for $BERA StakersOn July 22, Berachain officially launched the PoLv2 upgrade. This upgrade allows users to directly stake $BERA to obtain protocol-level收益, which comes from the $BERA repurchase mechanism of PoL incentives. It also sets a 7-day unbinding period to balance long-term ecological development. Non-$BERA incentives will be automatically converted to $BERA and injected into the收益 pool. In the future, it will also support收益 acquisition of liquid staking assets (LST). The收益率 data will be updated every 24 hours on the BeraHub platform. Initially, batch updates will be performed 2-3 times per week, and subsequently, it will gradually transition to daily updates. This upgrade, while maintaining the original logic of the application layer and reward vault, directly transforms ecological growth into staker收益 through protocol-layer design.

      <title>Li-Hua Yi: The bull market rotation law has begun, and mainstream coins have taken the lead.Yi Lihua, founder of LD Capital, posted on social media that the current crypto market&apos;s &quot;bull market rotation law&quot; has begun, with XRP, SOL, LTC, UNI and other mainstream currencies taking the lead in rising. He pointed out that as long as the US stock market does not have any surprises, after the crypto bill is implemented, Wall Street may have a large amount of funds entering the market in a concentrated manner. Yi Lihua also mentioned that he had tried to do swing trading in the past, but most of the time he bought high and sold low, resulting in &quot;mental exhaustion and losses&quot;. He said that in a bull market, he should focus on investing in potential targets in order to outperform the market as a whole. He previously stated that the rotation law of the crypto market usually manifests itself as BTC and ETH starting first, followed by medium-cap mainstream currencies, and finally altcoins rotating.
