      <title>Analysis: The batch unstaking of 620,000 ETH may be related to a surge in borrowing rates caused by a large withdrawal of ETH deposits from the Aave platform.According to X blogger darkpool&apos;s analysis, the batch unstaking of 620,000 ETH may be related to the massive withdrawal of ETH deposits from the Aave platform, which led to a surge in borrowing rates. The massive withdrawal of Aave ETH deposits in a short period of time led to a surge in borrowing rates, and leveraged lending players were forced to redeem stETH to deleverage, leading to the current situation. Aave ETH borrowing APR once soared to 10.00%; the waiting period for Lido stETH withdrawals has now been extended to 21 days (normally within a week), and there is still a discount of nearly 0.40% for on-chain stETH conversion to ETH.

      <title>Analysis: Ethereum&apos;s rise driven by ETFs and corporate funds, with supply-demand imbalance as the main reasonAccording to Bitwise analysis, since May 15, ETFs and corporate treasuries have purchased approximately 2.83M ETH, far exceeding the newly generated output during the same period, with a supply-demand ratio as high as 32:1. CIO Matt Hougan pointed out that this round of increase is mainly driven by structural capital inflows, rather than emotional factors. He expects that the net purchase volume of ETH may reach $2.00B in the next year, continuing to push up prices. (The Block) [Odaily]</title>

      <title>How Russia is using Kyrgyzstan’s crypto market to bypass sanctions: reportHas Russia turned Kyrgyzstan’s booming crypto market into a backdoor for moving funds? A new report sheds light on how Kyrgyz-registered exchanges are helping Russian networks evade sanctions. According to TRM Labs, Kyrgyzstan’s crypto industry has exploded from near-zero to billions in activity since passing its “On Virtual Assets” law back in 2022. By October 2024, authorities had issued 126 virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses, with licensed platforms recording $4.2 billion in transactions in the first seven months of 2024 alone. But with the region’s relatively weak oversight on the local industry, the rapid growth has made it an attractive base for entities seeking to bypass sanctions. TRM Labs’ report points to crypto exchanges Grinex and Meer, which sprang up in Kyrgyzstan shortly after U.S. law enforcement disrupted Russia’s Garantex in March 2025. On-chain analysis suggests both firms, suspected to be successors, used similar wallet infrastructure and transaction patterns as Garantex, helping Russian users move funds through A7A5, a Russian ruble-tied stablecoin that has long come under scrutiny. Crypto.news reported earlier in June that an FT research revealed that the A7A5 stablecoin has quietly moved billions since launch, and has ties to sanctioned entities that suggest it may be part of broader efforts to bypass Western sanctions and enable cross-border payments for Russian entities. Another exchange, Envoys Vision Digital Exchange (EVDE), was found to have ties to wallets linked to the Rusich Group, a sanctioned Russian paramilitary organization. Many of these platforms also display signs of being shell companies, including identical registration addresses, shared founders, and recycled contact information, suggesting coordinated or shared illicit control. TRM Labs warns that while Kyrgyzstan may be exploited rather than complicit, weak oversight leaves the door wide open. Without tighter controls on VASP registrations, clearer ownership rules, and stronger checks on shell companies, Russia’s financial networks will keep exploiting the country’s crypto infrastructure. If left unaddressed, similar tactics could also spread to neighboring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which are already rolling out crypto-friendly regulations, undermining international sanctions.

      <title>US Treasury Secretary Benson: Trump said he would not fire PowellJuly 23 news, according to Jinshi, US Treasury Secretary Bessant said: We are not in a hurry to nominate the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Fed&apos;s tariff analysis is &quot;a little wrong&quot;. (Talking about interest rate decisions) I don&apos;t know what the Fed is thinking. The review of the Federal Reserve may be to set up a committee. The Bank of England has done a good job in reviewing its past monetary policy. The frustration of the Fed&apos;s mission puts monetary policy independence at risk. Trump has said that he will not fire Powell. Economist El-Erian said that Powell should resign, which is a bit surprising. My regular talks with Federal Reserve Chairman Powell are still continuing. (Talking about Bowman as a candidate for Federal Reserve Chairman) Reluctant to reveal the name of the candidate. Powell has not yet indicated that he will leave his position on the board. Since the global financial crisis, regulation has been too strict. Trump always has a plan, it&apos;s just not always obvious. Trump has created the biggest negotiating leverage on tariffs. The selection of a successor to Governor Kugler is being carried out simultaneously. US Treasury Secretary Bessant (talking about Trump&apos;s tariff plan) The market reaction was relatively calm. U.S. Treasury Secretary Benson also said that he believes regional banks are strong contenders for the Federal Reserve chairmanship. [PANews]</title>
