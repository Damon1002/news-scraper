      <title>SpaceX moves $150 million in bitcoin after three-year dormancy: ArkhamOn Tuesday, Elon Musk&apos;s aerospace company SpaceX moved its crypto holdings for the first time in three years.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, SpaceX-linked wallet address &quot;15oKQ…7Jf1G&quot; moved 1,308 BTC ($150 million) to a new address &quot;bc1q8…hartf.&quot;

This marks the company&apos;s first crypto transaction since June 10, 2022, a period during which the firm regularly sent multiple batches of about 1,200 BTC to Coinbase. Between May 25 and June 10, 2022, SpaceX transferred 17,314 BTC to the cryptocurrency exchange.

SpaceX did not officially announce the crypto transaction nor reveal the reason for moving the bitcoin. The Block has reached out to the company for comments.

Following the latest transaction, SpaceX currently holds 6,977 BTC, worth $825 million, according to Arkham. Tesla, another company owned by Musk, holds 11,509 BTC ($1.36 billion).

Last month, Arkham wrote on X that Tesla and SpaceX held over $2 billion in bitcoin, which was acquired at an average price of around $32,000. &quot;Combined, Elon’s companies are up almost $1.5 BILLION on bitcoin,&quot; Arkham wrote.

Tuesday&apos;s Bitcoin movement from SpaceX coincides with accelerating mainstream adoption of bitcoin and crypto, significantly boosted by President Donald Trump&apos;s strong pro-crypto stance and recent advancements in crypto-friendly legislation. This trend has prompted numerous traditional finance firms to establish corporate bitcoin treasuries or launch crypto-infused services.

Meanwhile, Musk, a former close ally of Trump prior to their public fallout, recently announced the formation of the &quot;America Party,&quot; a new political entity aiming to challenge the two-party system. Musk stated on X that his new party would support bitcoin. [Arkham Intelligence]</title>

      <title>Ethereum Block Gas Limit Increased to 45 MillionThe Ethereum blockchain&apos;s block Gas limit has been increased to 45.00 million units, a 25% increase from the 36.00 million units set in February 2025. The Gas limit officially took effect at block number 22,968,004. This increase to 45.00 million is part of the Ethereum scaling roadmap, with validators aiming for a short-term goal of a 60.00 million Gas limit, and a long-term plan to achieve a 15.00 million Gas limit through the upcoming Fusaka hard fork and EIP-7935. To mitigate risks, developers have also introduced protective mechanisms such as EIP-7983, which sets the upper limit for Gas usage per transaction at 16.77 million units to prevent denial-of-service attacks and ensure network stability.

      <title>Sources: Bank of Japan expected to stick to gradual rate hike stance after Ishiba&apos;s Upper House election lossAccording to sources, Bank of Japan officials believe there is little need to change their stance on gradually raising interest rates after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba&apos;s setback in the Upper House election. Although officials will continue to closely monitor the government&apos;s fiscal policy, they still believe that continuing to raise the benchmark interest rate is appropriate if the economic outlook is as expected. Sources said the Policy Board, led by Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, is likely to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.50% at its meeting next week. Given that trade negotiations between Japan and the United States are still ongoing, officials want to assess the impact of the agreement on inflation trends and the economic outlook before raising interest rates again. Sources said that while the election results will not change the Bank of Japan&apos;s policy path at present, some officials believe that it is necessary to be wary of the upside risks to inflation that may result from a significant easing of fiscal policy. Officials have noted that inflation risks are rising as soaring food prices such as rice push up price increases more than expected. (Golden Ten) [Odaily Planet Daily News]</title>

      <title>JPMorgan Chase explores lending secured by clients’ cryptocurrencies: FTJPMorgan Chase is exploring plans to offer loans secured by customers’ cryptocurrency holdings, signaling a broader embrace of crypto assets by traditional financial institutions.

FT reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the bank is weighing plans to allow clients to borrow against crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether as early as next year, though the details remain subject to change.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has consistently expressed skepticism toward Bitcoin, but in May he acknowledged that the bank would facilitate client access to the cryptocurrency — though it does not plan to offer custody services.

According to the FT article, JPMorgan has already taken preliminary steps into the crypto sector, including plans to offer loans against crypto exchange-traded funds.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has repeatedly reaffirmed his negative stance on Bitcoin but acknowledged in May that the bank would work to allow clients to buy Bitcoin. In May, — but it will not keep custody.

The Block has reached out to JPMorgan for further comment.

The bank&apos;s move comes amid crypto-friendly regulatory shifts in the U.S., with President Donald Trump signing the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin bill, last week.

The GENIUS bill would establish a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, requiring them to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or other highly liquid assets. It would also mandate annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization exceeding $50 billion and establish rules for issuance by foreign entities. [Financial Times]</title>

      <title>Matrixport: Wall Street Crypto IPO Craze May Extend Bitcoin Bull Market CycleOn July 22, according to a recent report by independent analyst Markus Thielen, as several crypto companies prepare to go public, Wall Street investment banks intend to keep Bitcoin at a high level to create a favorable market environment for the upcoming IPOs. Currently, several companies, including Circle, have submitted prospectuses, and new projects are lining up to go public almost every week. At the same time, the stock prices of crypto-related listed companies have risen sharply, with MicroStrategy up 47.00%, Coinbase up 67.00%, Robinhood up 180.00%, and Circle up as much as 597.00%. This upsurge has not only boosted market sentiment and sustained investor profits, but also rapidly increased attention and enthusiasm for crypto company IPOs, which is expected to extend Bitcoin&apos;s current bull market cycle.

      <title>Could Pi Coin Repeat History With a 114% Price Rally? Here’s What to ExpectPi Coin is showing strong signs of recovery after breaking free from a two-month-long downtrend. The altcoin is now benefiting from improving market sentiment, especially as signs of an approaching altcoin season grow stronger. This momentum could position Pi Coin for a major price surge. Pi Coin Is Receiving Market Support At the time of writing, Pi Coin’s Bollinger Bands are converging. This technical pattern typically signals incoming volatility, and the last similar event occurred in May. Back then, Pi Coin recorded a massive 114% price increase shortly after the bands widened. A repeat of this move would depend on the broader crypto market’s direction. Currently, as Bitcoin consolidates and Ethereum leads altcoins upward, conditions favor another bullish breakout for Pi Coin. The tightening Bollinger Bands are hinting at imminent movement, and with sentiment leaning bullish, the next wave of volatility may well push Pi Coin higher once again. For token TA and market updates : Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter  here . The macro indicators also align with a bullish forecast. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is trending upward, indicating capital inflow into Pi Coin . This inflow suggests that investors are gaining confidence and could be positioning themselves ahead of a possible altcoin rally. As money enters the ecosystem, Pi Coin benefits from renewed market participation and rising demand. These factors often precede price breakouts and are especially influential when combined with technical signals of volatility. Can PI Price Bounce Back? Pi Coin is currently trading at $0.47 after consolidating sideways for several days. This consolidation has worked in its favor, helping the altcoin escape its two-month downtrend. Investors are now watching closely for the next resistance to be broken. Despite being only 15% from its all-time low of $0.40, the technical indicators suggest this support will hold. If Pi Coin can flip $0.45 into a reliable support level, it could initiate a rally toward $0.51 and beyond, especially if the altcoin season intensifies. However, if holders begin to exit their positions prematurely, Pi Coin could slip back toward $0.40. Such a move would invalidate the bullish scenario and place the altcoin at risk of retesting its historical low.</title>
