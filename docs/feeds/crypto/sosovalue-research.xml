      <title>Analysis: Every 10,000 BTC increase in ETF holdings could push the average price up by 1.8%, potentially reaching $150,000 in OctoberA report released by research firm Cooper Research points out that the rise in Bitcoin prices seems inevitable as investors pour large amounts of capital into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Data shows that for every 10,000 BTC increase in ETF holdings, the price of Bitcoin can increase by an average of 1.8%. Analysts point out that, based on a series of data indicators, Bitcoin seems ready to rise sharply again. The leverage-driven market frenzy is gradually subsiding, and the price trend of Bitcoin may take a more moderate path, and is expected to reach $140,000 in September, and may rise to $150,000 as early as the beginning of October.

      <title>Hong Kong Financial Services Development Council Chairman Hong Pi-Cheng: Stablecoins are a long-term battle, regulatory regime to be launched in AugustHong Kong Financial Services Development Council Chairman Fred Hu said in an exclusive interview with the Hong Kong Economic Times that stablecoins should not be used as short-term speculative tools, but rather as a long-term battle, with the key being to promote payment infrastructure and the digitalization of asset markets. Hong Kong will officially implement a stablecoin regulatory regime on August 1, providing a clear compliance framework that will help attract global institutions to conduct issuance, custody, and trading businesses in Hong Kong. Hong Kong does not intend to compete with U.S. dollar stablecoins, but rather focuses on consolidating its strategic position in financial technology infrastructure.</title>

      <title>Sources: EU Prepares Retaliation Plan Amidst US&apos;s Tough Trade StanceAccording to foreign media reports, EU envoys will meet as early as this week to develop countermeasures to deal with a possible &quot;no-deal&quot; scenario with US President Donald Trump. Trump&apos;s tariff negotiation stance is seen as having hardened ahead of the August 1 deadline. While the vast majority prefer to keep negotiations with Washington going in the hope of reaching a negotiated outcome to break the deadlock before next month&apos;s deadline, sources familiar with the matter said that efforts have not made sustained progress since talks in Washington last week. Negotiations will continue over the next two weeks. According to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named, the US now appears to want to impose tariffs higher than 10% on EU goods, with exemptions narrowing to only the aviation industry, some medical equipment and generics, certain alcoholic beverages, and a specific class of manufacturing equipment needed by the US.

      <title>Hong Hao: Ethereum is very likely to reach a new all-time highOn July 20th, renowned analyst Hong Hao published an article titled &quot;Asset Allocation with Ethereum and Bitcoin.&quot; The article points out that Ethereum and Bitcoin are like the two pillars of the digital world: Bitcoin is a store of value, while Ethereum is a tool for transactions. The &quot;GENIUS Act&quot; grants stablecoins legitimacy, and the issuance of stablecoins with Ethereum as the transaction settlement network will significantly increase the demand for Ethereum, causing its performance in July 2025 to surpass that of Bitcoin and very likely reach a new all-time high. In the short term, the development of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies will instead consolidate the dominant position of the U.S. dollar, while in the long term, it will promote a more open monetary system. Ethereum and Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, should all be an indispensable asset class for investors in this wave of digital assets.</title>
