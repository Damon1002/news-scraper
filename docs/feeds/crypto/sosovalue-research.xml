      <title>Telegram launches non-custodial crypto app in USMessaging app Telegram has launched a new non-custodial crypto wallet in the United States through a partnership with MoonPay. The new feature will enable millions of users to send and manage crypto directly within the app.

Telegram previously launched a crypto wallet globally that was activated by more than 100 million users. Tuesday’s launch will enable users in the U.S. to send, receive, and manage cryptocurrency directly inside the app.

The wallet is built on The Open Platform, a.k.a. TOP, which is built on the TON blockchain. The feature allows users to transact with crypto as easily as sending a message. Telegram said that the wallet will be instantly installed and will not require a download.

The Open Platform recently raised a $28.5 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation.

Telegram infamously fought the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in court after launching its TON token in 2019. After a protracted legal battle, Telegram agreed to return $1.2 billion to investors and pay an $18.5 million penalty to settle with the SEC.</title>

      <title>DevvStream pivots, anchors crypto treasury to BTC and SOLNasdaq-listed carbon management firm DevvStream unveiled Tuesday the initial composition of its digital asset treasury, naming Bitcoin, Solana and its own DevvE token as core holdings. The company also appointed BitGo as its qualified custodian and brought in FRNT Financial as a digital asset advisor, signaling a deliberate move to pair ESG mandates with programmable finance. DevvStream CEO Sunny Trinh said the company’s crypto treasury strategy is less about speculative upside and more about institutional-grade liquidity, ecosystem alignment, and real-world asset integration. “Our treasury model isn’t just about holding crypto. It’s about aligning capital with our mission,” Trinh said. “Our mix of assets is designed to deliver institutional-grade efficiency and income, while bridging to sustainability tokenization and real-world asset integration. Together, they position DevvStream at the intersection of liquidity, innovation, and impact.” Bitcoin (BTC), described by the company as the “foundational asset of the digital economy,” serves as the bedrock of its treasury, offering deep liquidity and institutional credibility. Unlike firms that treat BTC purely as a hedge, DevvStream appears to view it as an on-ramp for broader blockchain integration, ensuring stability while it experiments with more dynamic assets. Solana’s (SOL) inclusion is equally deliberate. The company cited SOL’s transaction speed and ecosystem depth as key factors, suggesting an intent to generate yield through staking or DeFi participation. This is a departure from passive Bitcoin holdings, aligning with a growing trend of corporations leveraging proof-of-stake networks for treasury management, where idle assets can earn returns without traditional market risks. But the most unconventional pick is DevvE, the company’s proprietary token. Unlike BTC and SOL, DevvE isn’t just a store of value or yield vehicle; it’s designed to facilitate what the firm calls “impact-layer tokenization,” linking digital finance directly to carbon offset projects and other sustainability initiatives. The company hasn’t disclosed exact allocation percentages.</title>

      <title>Wall Street is Warming Up to Rate Cuts—Will Crypto Be the Biggest Winner?Wall Street is increasingly betting on US interest rate cuts before the end of 2025. At the same time, political pressure from Donald Trump has intensified, as he becomes more vocally aggressive toward Powell for rate cuts.  With inflation cooling and markets adjusting expectations, crypto could stand to gain the most from a looser monetary policy. Trump Wants Fed to Bring Interest Rate Down to 1% Earlier today, Trump renewed his attack on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He called for a 3 percentage point rate cut and claimed it would save the US economy $1 trillion annually.  The US President also accused Powell of keeping rates high for “political reasons.” While the Fed has held rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% since June, speculation is rising. Goldman Sachs now expects the first cut to arrive in September.  Meanwhile, traders on prediction market Kalshi see a 40% chance of two cuts before year-end. This shift follows a steep drop in US inflation expectations . One-year consumer expectations fell to 4.4% in July, the lowest since February. That marks a 2.2 percentage point drop over just two months—one of the largest two-month declines in history. Longer-term inflation expectations are also easing. Five-year outlooks dropped 0.8 percentage points in the last quarter, now sitting at 3.6%.  Overall, these trends suggest the Fed has more room to ease without sparking fears of a price spiral. The crypto market is paying close attention. Bitcoin remains above $118,000 , while Ethereum holds near $3,700. Both assets have historically rallied after Fed rate cuts, benefiting from increased liquidity and investor risk appetite. Could a Major Crypto Bull Run Begin? Historically, rate cuts have kicked off strong crypto bull markets .  After the Fed slashed rates in March 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, Bitcoin soared from under $10,000 to over $60,000 within a year. Ethereum followed, supported by DeFi and NFT growth. If a new rate cut cycle begins in September, it could bring similar conditions. Lower yields push investors toward risk-on assets, including crypto.  Capital could also rotate from bonds and cash into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and high-conviction altcoins. Additionally, falling inflation expectations and improving regulatory clarity—such as the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts —may reinforce investor confidence.  This convergence of macro and policy signals could extend the current cycle beyond previous all-time highs. However, timing matters. Crypto is already near record levels, so momentum may depend on how fast and deep the cuts are. A delayed or shallow response from the Fed could limit upside. Key Dates to Watch The next Federal Reserve policy meeting will take place on July 29–30 . While markets expect no change, Fed commentary will be closely parsed for signals about September. The next critical date is September 16–17 , when the FOMC reconvenes. This is widely seen as the first realistic window for a rate cut, especially if inflation continues to decline. Other key indicators to monitor: For crypto traders, these dates offer cues for potential market inflection points. A confirmed Fed pivot could trigger renewed buying pressure, particularly in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and high-liquidity altcoins.</title>

      <title>Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers file amendments for in-kind redemptions, signaling &apos;positive movement&apos; with SECSeveral ETF issuers filed amendments with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to permit in-kind creations and redemptions from their spot crypto funds, something one expert says indicates that there is positive momentum going on at the agency.

21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Galaxy, VanEck, and WisdomTree all submitted their amended proposals Tuesday morning seeking to make their spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, as well as future crypto ETFs, more efficient.

&quot;More positive signs,&quot; Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said in a post on X .&quot;This indicates to me that there is positive movement and likely fine tuning happening with the SEC.&quot;

These firms have been seeking in-kind redemptions for months, and SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said last month that in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs are &quot;on the horizon.&quot;

&quot;Those (forms) are going through the process now,&quot; Peirce said on June 25. &quot;So I think that&apos;s something that&apos;s certainly on the horizon at some point. I can&apos;t prejudge, but we hear that there&apos;s a lot of interest.&quot;

Seyffart clarified that this would only be for the &quot;authorized participants&quot; like major Wall Street firms and market makers — not retail traders — to trade in shares of their ETFs for the underlying asset.

&quot;[T]he vast majority of people won&apos;t even see a difference because the products on the market now already trade extremely efficiently,&quot; Seyffart said. &quot;This will treat crypto ETPs the same as other ETPs are treated.

Crypto ETF &quot;floodgates&quot; are poised to open as the SEC is also weighing a faster approval framework, The Block&apos;s Sarah Wynn previously reported. Following spot BTC ETFs (January 2024) and spot ETH ETFs (July 2024), there are now several dozen more crypto-related ETFs seeking approval. [The Block]</title>

      <title>What is Zohran Mamdani’s Crypto Position Ahead of the New York Mayoral Election?New York’s viral mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has caused a social media storm with his ‘social democratic’ political ideology and engaging campaign approach. However, his crypto stance still remains in the grey. Meanwhile, Mamdani’s opposition is already turning to the crypto industry to swing public opinion. Zohran Mamdani’s Silence on Crypto New York City, a major cryptocurrency industry hub, is scheduled to hold a mayoral election on November 4, 2025. Current Mayor Eric Adams, elected as a Democrat, is seeking re-election as an independent candidate. Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York State, is also running. The two men, who formerly ran for offices on Democratic party tickets, are up against a rising newcomer in the NYC mayoral race. That would be 33-year-old New York assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who is running as a Democrat, winning the party’s nomination over Cuomo, who now plans to run as an independent. Already, Mamdani is quite popular, even to those outside of New York’s five boroughs. On July 16, Mamdani was in Washington. He was meeting with leading Democrats such as Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who both endorsed Mamdani in his party’s successful primary run against Cuomo. Sanders posted on Twitter/X on that day about Mamdami, saying he was “deeply impressed by the grassroots campaign he is running”. But Mamdani has never talked about crypto. BeInCrypto reached out to Mamdani, both his campaign and council office, for comments on the blockchain industry. There was no response as of press time. Though his following is largely a younger demographic, he hasn’t yet addressed policy regarding blockchain and cryptocurrency in a city well-known for the industry. Some in crypto might be concerned. Leading Democrats have been critical of cryptocurrency, mainly due to consumer protection issues. Will Mamdani’s Political Ideology Hamper New York’s Crypto Progress? The most outspoken Democrat member of the crypto opposition is Elizabeth Warren, who told CNBC on July 17 that Mamdani is “willing to try new ideas”. That might not be enough to convince cryptocurrency advocates Mamdani is the right person to push blockchain technology forward in NYC, where companies like Uniswap, OpenSea and ConsenSys are headquartered. “Not bullish,” said Brian Mahoney, based in NYC as vice president of business development for Thesis, a Bitcoin startup accelerator. Influential Democrats like Warren have been outspoken critics of the cryptocurrency industry. And Mamdani’s position as a “socialist” Democrat may not align with the free market ideals of blockchain and cryptocurrency. It’s hard to tell when Mamdani’s positioning is not yet clear. It may take some time before that positioning crystallizes ahead of the election in November. Many cryptocurrency companies that would rather have less regulation, especially in light of New York State’s onerous BitLicense requirements, could be concerned if Mamdani starts to criticize the industry. Yet the majority of crypto companies concerned about tougher regulations in New York may have some fear of a very left-leaning mayoral candidate like Mamdani. This is largely because Mamdani plans to make busing in NYC free and freeze rents for citizens. Already, opponent and incumbent Eric Adams is busy courting cryptocurrency, seeing it as an opportunity for fundraising. Empower NYC, a super PAC, is raising up to $10 million for Adams, largely from the crypto and banking industry. It will be interesting to see what Mamdani’s views and positioning will be about crypto. To him, is it a world-changing good for the people? Or does he view it as harmful for the people of New York City, despite it being an industry epicenter? Only time and Mamdani’s positioning will truly tell. [BeInCrypto]</title>

      <title>Justin Sun to Become Youngest Chinese Commercial Astronaut with Blue Origin’s New ShepardGeneva, Switzerland - July 22, 2025 - Justin Sun, founder of TRON and one of the most recognizable figures in crypto, is set to make history as the youngest Chinese-born commercial astronaut and the first Forbes-cover crypto entrepreneur to travel to space aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard. This mission is the 14th human flight for the New Shepard program and the 34th in its history. The flight date will be announced soon. The live webcast on launch day will start 30 minutes before liftoff.

In 2021, Sun placed the winning bid for the first seat on New Shepard. The $28 million in proceeds were donated to Blue Origin’s foundation, Club for the Future, which selected 19 space-focused non-profits to each receive a $1 million grant to inspire future generations to pursue careers in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) for the benefit of Earth and help invent the future of life in space.

“We are witnessing the beginning of a new chapter in human exploration, where space is no longer reserved for governments or institutions but is becoming a frontier for innovators, dreamers, and builders from all walks of life,” said Sun. “Blue Origin’s commitment to expanding access to space, along with Club for the Future’s mission to inspire young people worldwide, reflects a powerful vision. I am proud to support this effort and help advance the belief that space is a place for everyone, not just a select few.”

Sun’s upcoming flight is more than a personal milestone. It highlights the growing international presence in commercial space travel and the increasing connection between blockchain and scientific innovation. As a leading voice in the digital economy and a strong advocate for decentralized technology, his journey reflects the broader potential for global collaboration and progress at the frontier of space exploration.
