      <title>Bank of America: Stablecoin Supply Could Grow by $25.00B-$75.00B in the Near Term Following Passage of GENIUS ActOn July 24, according to CoinDesk, Bank of America stated that President Trump&apos;s signing of the GENIUS Act last Friday marks a turning point in US stablecoin regulation, and the stablecoin supply is expected to grow by $25.00B - $75.00B in the near future. The bank noted in its report that this growth will be driven by product launches, infrastructure investments, and competition from tokenized deposits and money market funds. The total market capitalization of stablecoins is currently about $270.00B. Bank of America analysts expect that in the next 2-3 years, with the enactment of the CLARITY Act, stablecoins will consolidate and drive the wider adoption of these cryptocurrencies and other tokenized assets. The bill aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for US digital assets. [Techflow]</title>

      <title>Bank of America: Doubts about the Fed&apos;s independence put pressure on the dollar, market concerns about easing bias intensify.On July 24, according to Jinshi Data, Bank of America strategist Alex Cohen said that uncertainty surrounding the Fed&apos;s leadership prospects is weakening the dollar&apos;s performance, with related concerns &quot;clearly affecting the dollar earlier than other assets&quot; and may be the main obstacle to the dollar&apos;s failure to rebound. &quot;Even if future leadership changes are carried out in a more conventional manner, the market is beginning to anticipate a more relaxed Fed environment,&quot; Cohen noted. Trump continues to pressure Fed Chairman Powell to cut interest rates and plans to visit the Fed headquarters today, further highlighting signs of political intervention. [Techflow TechFlow]</title>

      <title>Bank of America: U.S. stablecoin supply may increase by $25 billion to $75 billion in the short term due to the GENIUS ActOn July 24, according to CoinDesk, Bank of America said that with the passage of the GENIUS Act, the supply of stablecoins is expected to grow by $25 billion to $75 billion in the short term. The bill lays the foundation for stablecoin regulation in the United States and promotes the development of related infrastructure and tokenized finance. Bank of America also pointed out that the banking industry is preparing to issue stablecoins through a consortium model, and this growth is expected to drive an increase in demand for U.S. Treasuries and promote the widespread adoption of digital assets.

      <title>Anchorage Digital to issue first GENIUS‑compliant stablecoin in US with Ethena LabsAnchorage Digital, the first federally chartered crypto bank in the United States, will issue Ethena Labs’ USDtb token onshore as the first stablecoin engineered to comply with the new GENIUS Act, the companies said on Thursday.

Ethena’s USDtb is a yield-bearing dollar token primarily backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL and crypto collateral rather than traditional reserves to maintain its $1 peg. The synthetic stablecoin has circulated offshore since December and amassed $1.45 billion in total value locked, according to DefiLlama data.

Under the partnership, Anchorage Digital Bank will mint and redeem USDtb tokens directly in the U.S., bringing the asset under a federal regulatory umbrella for the first time. Anchorage said its stablecoin issuance platform will serve as a turnkey infrastructure for Ethena’s stablecoin to “launch and distribute fully regulated digital dollars.”

The move comes one week after President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the country’s first law governing stablecoin issuance. Industry players and U.S. officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expect the legislation to accelerate demand from asset managers, payments firms, and corporates looking for yield‑bearing, programmable dollars.

The passage of GENIUS gives federally regulated institutions a green light and clarity to participate in the stablecoin ecosystem, Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley noted in the release.

Guy Young, Ethena Labs CEO, added that products like USDtb stand to benefit from federal oversight and regulated appetite. “While we’ve already seen strong demand for USDtb, we expect GENIUS compliance to empower our partners and holders to confidently and significantly expand its use across new products and platforms,” he said.

Anchorage’s announcement positions it alongside giants such as Circle and PayPal, which already operate dollar‑pegged tokens but must adapt to GENIUS requirements. Major banks like JPMorganand Citihave flagged plans to experiment with stablecoins and deposit‑backed tokens once the rules settle. [companies]</title>

      <title>$TRUMP Goes Live On TRON NetworkJuly 24, 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland - TRON DAO, a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps, announced today the official deployment of $TRUMP on the TRON blockchain. The token expansion is enabled by LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard and Stargate Finance’s user interface and liquidity transport protocol. Together, they provide a framework for cross-chain transfers of $TRUMP while maintaining a unified supply. This development positions TRON at the forefront of the evolving digital asset landscape, where real-world value transfer, speed, and accessibility are critical to mainstream growth.

The deployment of $TRUMP on TRON introduces the token to one of the most actively used blockchain networks in the world. TRON hosts over 321 million user accounts and over $20 billion in daily transfer volume, with a circulating supply of more than $80 billion in USDT on the network. Its infrastructure is optimized for high-speed and low-cost transactions, making it an ideal blockchain for a token like $TRUMP that seeks to scale across everyday use cases—from DeFi engagement to community activations and potentially real-world payments.

“TRON is built to support scale, inclusion, and real-world use,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of $TRUMP on TRON reflects our belief in giving community-powered assets a network that can help them thrive globally.”

LayerZero’s integration plays a critical role in this launch, offering secure and seamless cross-chain functionality through its Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. This allows $TRUMP to move across supported blockchains without relying on traditional bridges or wrapped assets, reducing fragmentation and increasing accessibility. Stargate Finance, a liquidity network for cross-chain transfer for assets built on top of LayerZero protocol, supports $TRUMP bridging to and from TRON, further strengthening its liquidity and multichain utility.

By bringing $TRUMP into the TRON ecosystem, TRON DAO plans to explore DeFi and payment utility to the token as they continue to champion a vision of open, scalable blockchain infrastructure that supports emerging digital assets and unlocks new channels for community and financial participation. The commitment reinforces TRON DAO’s commitment to expanding its reach through innovative, user-centric initiatives that align with the decentralized ethos of the crypto space. With the addition of $TRUMP, TRON continues to prove itself as a dynamic technology for the next generation of token-based innovation.
