      <title>Strategy upsizes preferred &apos;Stretch&apos; stock offering to $2.00 billion to buy more bitcoinBitcoin treasury firm Strategy plans to quadruple the size of its recently announced Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock offer to $2.00 billion from $500.00 million after strong demand for bitcoin‑focused shares, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Moelis, and TD Securities are bookrunners on the latest Stretch sale.

Proceeds from Strategy’s expanded facility are earmarked to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. Last week, the company spent $739.90 million generated from share sales on 6,220 BTC, increasing its holdings to 607,770, The Block’s data shows. That’s currently valued at over $72.00 billion and roughly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million.

The company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, will offer Stretch shares at a price of $90 per share, a 10% discount to face value and the low end of a marketed range of $100. The securities carry an initial 9% annual dividend that Strategy can reset monthly.

Stretch, the company’s fourth preferred stock program, reportedly ranks senior to the firm’s Strike (STRK) and Stride (STRD) preferred stock and its common shares, but subordinate to its Strife (STRF) preferred series and outstanding convertible notes.

Earlier this week, TD Cowen said the company’s preferred‑stock arsenal could help Strategy lift its holdings to nearly 900,000 BTC by 2027, arguing each share controls more Bitcoin today than 18 months ago despite aggressive issuance. Strategy’s net asset value premium, the percentage by which its market cap surpasses its BTC holdings, is justified since the company can effectively borrow at low rates and stockpile crypto’s largest asset, the brokerage stated.

Strategy’s common stock is trading around $414, giving the firm a market capitalization of $124.00 billion, according to The Block’s data dashboard. [Bloomberg]</title>

      <title>Resolv Enables Protocol Fee Mechanism, Returns Will Reward Stakers and Drive Ecosystem ExpansionResolv has announced the official launch of a protocol fee mechanism starting in July 2025, where a portion of the daily revenue will be used for long-term value accumulation and distributed to RESOLV stakers. The protocol fee will gradually increase to 10% of daily profits over 4 weeks and will only be charged when there is a positive return, without affecting the principal or days with zero returns. Protocol revenue will be used to expand DeFi and institutional integration, fund ecosystem development, promote token buybacks, and usage will be made public through a transparent dashboard.

      <title>Centralized exchange WOO X investigates &apos;contained incident&apos; resulting in estimated $14 million lossWOO X, a little-known centralized crypto trading platform, said it is investigating “a contained incident” impacting nine customer accounts on Thursday. The company noted that “unauthorized withdrawals were placed,” totalling an estimated $14 million.

“The incident was quickly detected and as a precaution, withdrawals were paused and many of the withdrawals were blocked,” WOO X said. “We&apos;ve already contacted the affected users, and all unauthorized withdrawals will be covered.”

The firm said it is working with external security teams and other exchanges to halt the flow of funds. WOO X trading volumes have spiked 264.8% over the past 24-hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Crypto security firm Cyvers has begun tracking funds as they move along the Arbitrum, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Tron networks. The firm said about $1 million worth of USDT was swapped into ETH with an additional $7.3 million worth of funds later sent to a new address.

An additional five wrapped BTC tokens on the BNB Chain were swapped into BNB tokens and sent to a new address, Cyvers said.

Crypto hacks are not an uncommon occurrence in the industry. Chainalysis estimates there were losses totaling at least $2.2 billion in 2024 across centralized and decentralized blockchain platforms. This represents a 21.07% year-over-year increase during a year that saw rising crypto prices, which is typically a driving factor in increasing crypto crime.

WOO X is a Seychelles-registered centralized exchange established in 2019. The firm most recently raised $9 million in a 2024 funding round with participation from Wintermute, Selini Capital, among others.

Notably, in 2023, WOO X temporarily paused trading activity after its largest market maker and incubator, Kronos Research, experienced a $25 million hack, in a move that caused it to revamp its market mechanisms. [WOO X]</title>

      <title>Ethereum holding company GameSquare purchases CryptoPunk NFT as treasury asset for $5.15 million in preferred sharesIn something of a novel move for the increasingly saturated crypto treasury space, Ethereum holding company GameSquare (ticker GAME) has acquired a CryptoPunk NFT. The firm says it will now hold the “iconic” piece as a “strategic treasury asset.”

GameSquare purchased the token — Punk #5577, one of just 24 “Ape Punks” — for $5.15 million in an equity trade with its previous owner, DeFi OG Robert Leshner. The preferred stock will be convertible into common shares at $1.50 per share.

Leshner, the founder of Superstate and Compound, appears to have purchased CryptoPunk #5577 in February 2022 for 2,501 ETH, equivalent to approximately $7.7 million at the time. The asset is distinguished by its cowboy hat.

The 10,000 token CryptoPunks series was one of the earliest experiments with non-fungible tokens when launched in 2017. Yuga Labs, which bought the CryptoPunks IP from creator Larva Labs in March 2022, sold the project to the nonprofit Infinite Node Foundation in May of this year.

“This isn’t just our first grail NFT, it’s a signal of how we’re thinking differently and expanding our existing footprint in digital culture by building a next-generation media company with crypto in its DNA,” Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare, said in a statement.

GameSquare is one of many newly emerging Ethereum treasury firms. Early this month, the firm’s board approved a $100 million ETH treasury authorization, which was later expanded to $250 million. The firm has acquired approximately 10,170.74 ETH, now worth $52 million, as of July 21.

Unlike other ETH balance sheet plays that typically stake their holdings for yield, GameSquare said it will pursue higher returns through DeFi deployments, namely Dialectic’s institutional Medici platform. The board also approved an initial $10 million allocation to an NFT yield strategy, targeting 6%–10% annualized returns.

According to the announcement on Thursday, Leshner has joined the firm as an advisor and will help it tokenize its GAME shares on the Superstate platform.

Recently, Leshner’s attempt at a hostile takeover of a “low market cap” liquor firm to start a crypto treasury was thwarted after its executives diluted his ownership.

      <title>JPMorgan Chase: Crypto market inflows have reached $60.00B so far this year, with investors&apos; interest in altcoins on the riseJPMorgan Chase analysts estimate that $600.00B in capital has flowed into digital assets since the beginning of the year, mainly driven by inflows into crypto funds, active trading in CME futures, and venture capital fundraising activities. Analysts point out that inflows have grown by nearly 50.00% since the end of May and are on track to easily surpass last year&apos;s historical record. Analysts say that the increasingly friendly regulatory environment in the United States is one of the key drivers. Investor interest in altcoins is also on the rise. Among them, Ethereum is the biggest beneficiary due to its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, and its increasing inclusion in corporate treasury allocations along with Bitcoin. More and more asset management companies intend to launch crypto ETFs based on altcoins and introduce staking mechanisms. (The Block) [Odaily Planet Daily News]</title>

      <title>BlackRock Ethereum ETF&apos;s assets exceeded $10 billion in one yearReported on July 24 that according to The Block, BlackRock&apos;s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) ETHA has exceeded $10 billion in assets under management in less than a year, becoming the third ETF in history to reach this milestone within a year. Eric Balchunas, senior analyst at Bloomberg ETF, said on the X platform that ETHA&apos;s assets jumped from $5 billion to $10 billion in just 10 days, showing the strong appeal of Ethereum among institutional investors. Data shows that on July 23, the cumulative inflows of nine tradable Ethereum funds in the United States reached $8.65 billion, while ETHA had a net inflow of $325 million on the same day. Analysts predict that ETFs and Ethereum-related companies may purchase $20 billion worth of Ethereum in the next year, further boosting market demand. [PANews]</title>

      <title>UK is Sitting On Billions In Bitcoin, But How Will The Government Use It?This week, the United Kingdom made headlines after reports revealed it was considering selling $7.00 billion worth of Bitcoin confiscated during a 2018 law enforcement seizure. The extra cash comes at a crucial time for the UK as it grapples with a fragile financial position. While the UK considers selling its seized Bitcoin, doing so could lead to billions in lost opportunities. Mark Pearce, General Counsel at Alkimi, emphasized that the situation presents a complex dilemma rather than a clear-cut solution for the UK. A £5 Billion Question For British Leaders The United Kingdom’s Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is currently sitting on over 61,000 Bitcoins worth over £5.00 billion. The substantial stockpile came from a major law enforcement seizure in 2018 that disrupted a major money laundering operation in the UK. The funds originated from a massive Chinese Ponzi scheme that had defrauded approximately 128,000 investors in China since 2014. Recent reports suggest that Reeves is considering selling these confiscated Bitcoin assets to help address the UK’s weakened fiscal position. The government faces significant financial challenges, with a budget deficit of £57.80 billion. The UK’s national debt has also reached historically high levels, currently amounting to £2.87 trillion. These financial pressures, paired with increasing costs for paying interest on that debt and growing demands for government spending, are creating a significant political challenge for the current government. Given the context, it’s no surprise that the Chancellor is considering filling in the gaps with revenue from selling its Bitcoin stockpile. The UK’s Fiscal Tightrope The UK government selling its seized Bitcoin could help close the current hole in its public finances. Such an injection could reduce further government borrowing, easing pressure on the national debt and associated interest payments. Skeptics who perceive Bitcoin as a highly volatile and unproductive asset would also celebrate the move. Some see the government holding billions of pounds worth of a speculative asset as imprudent when public finances are strained. Selling allows it to deploy this capital for immediate public benefit. Since the amount the government would sell is small compared to Bitcoin’s total market capitalization, the market impact would be minimal. However, he also questioned whether it would be prudent for the government to sell these assets in the short term. To Sell Or Not To Sell? Though Jian Wen, one of the key money laundering facilitators behind the Chinese Ponzi scheme, has been convicted and sentenced, other parts of the criminal case are still ongoing. Specifically, the fate of the Bitcoin stockpile is still subject to continuing civil recovery proceedings. The UK government is actively seeking to formalize its ownership of the assets for the Treasury. Until this process is finalized, Pearce believes the government should not sell off its holdings. This waiting period also offers a welcome delay for Bitcoin enthusiasts, who believe the UK should hold onto its Bitcoin to benefit from its increasing value. The High Cost of Selling Early Selling the seized Bitcoin offers the UK government immediate financial benefits, but also risks forfeiting significant future gains. Selling now means locking in the current value and potentially forfeiting billions of pounds that would be generated if Bitcoin’s price continues to climb. This risk has already been compared to when former Chancellor Gordon Brown sold off a significant portion of the UK’s gold reserves. The UK can also look to its German neighbor as an example of a missed opportunity. Last July, Germany sold nearly 50,000 BTC for over $2.89 billion. Authorities reportedly chose to sell due to concerns about the cryptocurrency’s volatility. Almost immediately after the sales, Bitcoin’s price continued its upward trajectory. Today, it rests at $118,400. Arkham Intelligence estimated that if Germany had held onto the Bitcoin, its value would have been $5.24 billion by May 2025. What Lies Ahead: A Blueprint for Seized Crypto The UK government faces a highly disputed decision. While the immediate multi-billion-pound windfall from selling its seized Bitcoin offers a crucial lifeline for its strained public finances, it must carefully weigh this against the significant gamble of potentially missing out on even greater future gains. Whatever it decides will shape the global conversation on how governments should manage digital assets born from illicit activity.</title>

      <title>U.S. House of Representatives promotes the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, emphasizing its non-partisan natureOn July 24, according to Eleanor Terrett, at a press conference before the House of Representatives&apos; August recess, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said he would work hard to win more Senate Democrats&apos; support for his Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act. The bill aims to make it clear that blockchain developers and infrastructure providers (such as miners, validators, and node operators) are not considered money transmitters as long as they do not host funds. Emmer called the bill a &quot;non-partisan issue,&quot; emphasizing that there are clear rules to protect Americans and innovators, and said he welcomes the Senate&apos;s adjustments and improvements to the bill during the review process.
