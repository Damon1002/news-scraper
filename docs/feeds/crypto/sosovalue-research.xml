      <title>Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Stablecoins will have a disruptive impact on traditional bank deposits and payment systemsOn July 21, according to Phoenix.com, the latest research report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch shows that as the US stablecoin regulatory framework gradually takes effect, stablecoins will have a disruptive impact on traditional bank deposits and payment systems in the next 2-3 years. The US President has signed the GENIUS Act to set a preliminary framework for stablecoin regulation. In the short term, the stablecoin market is expected to grow by $25-75 billion, which will boost demand for US short-term Treasury bonds. Although major banks are cautious about domestic payment applications, they generally believe that cross-border payments are a feasible scenario and have begun to deploy related businesses, including JPMorgan Chase&apos;s deposit tokens and Bank of New York Mellon&apos;s custody services.

      <title>Consensys to release fix for MetaMask browser extensionAccording to Cointelegraph, Consensys stated that it has noticed some MetaMask users reporting &quot;abnormally high disk activity&quot; and will release a fix soon. Previously, user ripper31337 pointed out in a GitHub bug report on June 24 that after reinstalling the MetaMask extension on Chromium-based browsers (such as Chrome, Edge, and Opera), the program was found to be continuously writing data to the solid-state drive (SSD) in the background without user interaction. This &quot;abnormal disk writing&quot; occurs at a rate of 5M per second, totaling 500G bytes per day, accumulating to 25 TB in three months. [Foresight News]</title>

      <title>Sui Announces Integration with NEAR Intents, Introducing Ultra-Fast Cross-Chain Swaps to the EcosystemOn July 21st, Sui announced its integration with NEAR Intents. NEAR Intents is built on the NEAR blockchain. This integration allows Sui users to bypass traditional complex smart contract processes. Instead, they only need to express their intent, and the request will be automatically routed by &quot;solvers&quot; who will select the optimal execution path. This enables seamless interaction with 20 chains and over 80 assets, providing an extremely fast and simple cross-chain exchange experience. Currently, users can directly exchange assets from other chains such as NEAR, BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, ZEC into the Sui ecosystem without relying on bridging or intermediate tools.

The integration is now officially live and available. Developers can now directly integrate NEAR Intents into Sui applications to enhance functionality and expand user reach. In the coming weeks, more Sui native assets will be supported, further expanding its application value.

The integration of Sui with NEAR Intents will enhance Sui&apos;s ecosystem interoperability and further build a flywheel for ecosystem growth, especially at this critical juncture of rapid Sui DeFi development. To date, Sui TVL has exceeded $2.2 billion, ranking 8th among all blockchains. In the past 30 days, Sui DEX trading volume exceeded $8.1 billion, ranking 8th. Meanwhile, the market cap of Sui stablecoins exceeded $1 billion in June, an increase of over 180% since the beginning of the year.

      <title>JPMorgan Chase data-charging plan could &quot;destroy&quot; crypto and fintech startups, executive warnsOn July 21, according to Fortune magazine, last month, when JPMorgan Chase informed fintech companies that it planned to charge them for accessing its customers&apos; bank account data, the move caused a strong reaction in many areas of the financial industry. According to four industry executives, the move is a blow to the fintech industry and may have a devastating impact on early startups, including those in the cryptocurrency industry. However, analysts believe that mature fintech companies such as PayPal and Block (formerly Square) may not be greatly affected by this fee adjustment.
Under the plan, the bank could charge data aggregators fees every time a consumer moves money from JPMorgan to a cryptocurrency account or a third-party service like Robinhood. Crypto and fintech companies often use aggregators like Plaid or MX to access customer accounts at major financial institutions like JPMorgan. So far, banks haven’t charged fintech companies, but that could change. Aggregators are widely expected to pass on the new fees to fintech customers, and some may even pass the costs on to consumers.

      <title>CITIC Securities: The US Stablecoin Act has been implemented, and relaxed regulation is conducive to market expansionOn July 21, according to Zhitong Finance, the CITIC Securities Research Report stated that on July 17, Eastern Time, the U.S. Congress passed the GENIUS Act, marking the official implementation of the first federal-level stablecoin regulatory framework in the United States. From the perspective of the bill&apos;s advancement process, after the passage of the &quot;Big and Beautiful Act&quot;, crypto legislation was quickly listed as the top agenda of the House of Representatives, and Trump personally promoted consensus within the Republican Party, highlighting the priority of the crypto field in the U.S. policy framework. From the content of the bill, the House of Representatives did not make substantive changes to the version passed by the Senate, and still retained a relatively loose regulatory framework with the federal government as the main body and the state level as the supplement. Looking ahead, as the regulatory details of the GENIUS Act are implemented, U.S. financial and technology giants are expected to accelerate their entry, promote the accelerated diffusion of stablecoins from issuance to application scenarios, and may bring about the continued expansion of the stablecoin market size.
