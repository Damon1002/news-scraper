      <title>Analysis: Ethereum&apos;s rise driven by ETFs and corporate funds, with supply-demand imbalance as the main reasonAccording to Bitwise analysis, since May 15, ETFs and corporate treasuries have purchased approximately 2.83M ETH, far exceeding the newly generated output during the same period, with a supply-demand ratio as high as 32:1. CIO Matt Hougan pointed out that this round of increase is mainly driven by structural capital inflows, rather than emotional factors. He expects that the net purchase volume of ETH may reach $2.00B in the next year, continuing to push up prices. (The Block) [Odaily]</title>

      <title>FBI Ends Kraken Founder Jesse Powell Probe, Returns Seized DevicesThe FBI has officially closed its investigation into Kraken founder Jesse Powell and returned multiple electronic devices seized during a 2023 raid. Federal prosecutors sent Powell a declination letter confirming that no charges were filed and that the case is now closed. Federal Authorities Close Case, Return Devices With the FBIâs decision, a high-profile legal chapter ends for one of cryptoâs leading figures. According to Fortune and court documents, the US Department of Justice issued a formal declination letter, confirming Powell will face no charges. Numerous electronic devices seized during the investigation have now been returned, verifying the matterâs conclusion. Attorney statements and filings confirm the caseâs closure, and the lack of any public press release from the DOJ or FBI further shows that no criminal findings arose. Importantly, the FBIâs inquiry was completely separate from Powellâs work at Kraken or any cryptocurrency issue. Investigators focused instead on allegations related to the Verge Center for the Arts, a Sacramento nonprofit Powell co-founded. According to reports, this dispute centered on a $500,000.00 donation from Powell and disagreements among board members. Powellâs legal filings in the California Superior Court detail his civil claims against board members. Powell alleges mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty, which triggered the federal probe. Powell Responds to Investigationâs End The raid and investigation took a toll on Powellâs reputation and daily life. During the probe, he endured scrutiny as authorities held his devices. Now, with his property restored and no charges filed, Powell states he intends to move forward. Powellâs statement reflects both relief and determination to resume momentum at Kraken. As the legal saga ends, his focus now shifts to ongoing civil litigation against Vergeâs board, maintaining that the allegations lacked merit. Legal experts point out that reputational and financial impacts can linger, even after investigations close without charges. Therefore, Powellâs priority is rebuilding his public image and defending his philanthropic intentions in court. [Fortune]</title>

      <title>How Russia is using Kyrgyzstanâs crypto market to bypass sanctions: reportHas Russia turned Kyrgyzstanâs booming crypto market into a backdoor for moving funds? A new report sheds light on how Kyrgyz-registered exchanges are helping Russian networks evade sanctions. According to TRM Labs, Kyrgyzstanâs crypto industry has exploded from near-zero to billions in activity since passing its âOn Virtual Assetsâ law back in 2022. By October 2024, authorities had issued 126 virtual asset service provider (VASP) licenses, with licensed platforms recording $4.2 billion in transactions in the first seven months of 2024 alone. But with the regionâs relatively weak oversight on the local industry, the rapid growth has made it an attractive base for entities seeking to bypass sanctions. TRM Labsâ report points to crypto exchanges Grinex and Meer, which sprang up in Kyrgyzstan shortly after U.S. law enforcement disrupted Russiaâs Garantex in March 2025. On-chain analysis suggests both firms, suspected to be successors, used similar wallet infrastructure and transaction patterns as Garantex, helping Russian users move funds through A7A5, a Russian ruble-tied stablecoin that has long come under scrutiny. Crypto.news reported earlier in June that an FT research revealed that the A7A5 stablecoin has quietly moved billions since launch, and has ties to sanctioned entities that suggest it may be part of broader efforts to bypass Western sanctions and enable cross-border payments for Russian entities. Another exchange, Envoys Vision Digital Exchange (EVDE), was found to have ties to wallets linked to the Rusich Group, a sanctioned Russian paramilitary organization. Many of these platforms also display signs of being shell companies, including identical registration addresses, shared founders, and recycled contact information, suggesting coordinated or shared illicit control. TRM Labs warns that while Kyrgyzstan may be exploited rather than complicit, weak oversight leaves the door wide open. Without tighter controls on VASP registrations, clearer ownership rules, and stronger checks on shell companies, Russiaâs financial networks will keep exploiting the countryâs crypto infrastructure. If left unaddressed, similar tactics could also spread to neighboring Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which are already rolling out crypto-friendly regulations, undermining international sanctions.

      <title>US Treasury Secretary Benson: Trump said he would not fire PowellJuly 23 news, according to Jinshi, US Treasury Secretary Bessant said: We are not in a hurry to nominate the chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Fed&apos;s tariff analysis is &quot;a little wrong&quot;. (Talking about interest rate decisions) I don&apos;t know what the Fed is thinking. The review of the Federal Reserve may be to set up a committee. The Bank of England has done a good job in reviewing its past monetary policy. The frustration of the Fed&apos;s mission puts monetary policy independence at risk. Trump has said that he will not fire Powell. Economist El-Erian said that Powell should resign, which is a bit surprising. My regular talks with Federal Reserve Chairman Powell are still continuing. (Talking about Bowman as a candidate for Federal Reserve Chairman) Reluctant to reveal the name of the candidate. Powell has not yet indicated that he will leave his position on the board. Since the global financial crisis, regulation has been too strict. Trump always has a plan, it&apos;s just not always obvious. Trump has created the biggest negotiating leverage on tariffs. The selection of a successor to Governor Kugler is being carried out simultaneously. US Treasury Secretary Bessant (talking about Trump&apos;s tariff plan) The market reaction was relatively calm.

      <title>Security agency: A BSC unverified contract was attacked, with losses exceeding $600,000.On July 23, blockchain security agency BlockSec Phalcon issued a warning that its system detected a series of malicious transactions against an unverified contract (0x16d7c6f43df19778e382b7a84bcb8c763971a551) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), causing losses of more than $600,000. Since the contract is not open source, investigations show that the vulnerability stems from the lack of slippage protection, and the attacker used a fake liquidity pool to harvest TA tokens (0x539ae81a166e5e80aed211731563e549c411b140) and sold them in a legitimate pool for profit. BlockSec Phalcon strongly recommends that users who have authorized the contract immediately revoke permissions to prevent further losses. [PANews]</title>

      <title>EU prepares 100 billion euro &quot;no deal&quot; plan to deal with 30% US tariffsJuly 23 news, according to foreign media reports, if the negotiations break down and US President Trump fulfills his threat to impose a 30% tariff on most EU exports after August 1, the EU plans to quickly impose a 30% tariff on US products worth about 100.00 billion euros (about 117.00 billion US dollars). A spokesman for the European Commission said on Wednesday that as part of the first wave of countermeasures, the EU will combine the already approved tariff list for 21.00 billion euros of US goods and the previously proposed tariff list for another 72.00 billion euros of US products into a package. According to people familiar with the matter, US exports, including Boeing aircraft, US-made cars and industrial products such as bourbon whiskey, will face tariffs matching Trump&apos;s threat of 30%. These people said that the tariffs will be ready to take effect next month, but only if the negotiations break down and the United States implements its tax measures after the August deadline. An unnamed government official said that in the absence of an agreement, Berlin is even willing to support the activation of the EU&apos;s &quot;anti-coercion tool&quot; (ACI). This tool will only be activated if an agreement cannot be reached. [PANews]</title>
