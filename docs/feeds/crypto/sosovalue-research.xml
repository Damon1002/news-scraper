      <title>Bitcoin Treasury Capital CEO: I learned about Bitcoin while studying Chinese in ShanghaiOn July 20, Bitcoin Treasury Capital CEO Christoffer De Geer published an article on the X platform, revealing that he needed to remit money to Sweden when he was studying Chinese in Shanghai in 2013. When he was looking for alternatives, he accidentally learned about Bitcoin. As a Swede in China, he found a 12-year-old Bitcoin miner and began to learn about wallets, keys, UTXO, block browsers, and an anonymous person named Satoshi Nakamoto.
Today, Bitcoin Treasury Capital already holds 156 bitcoins and has reached an equity financing agreement of up to 200 million Swedish kronor with a group of investors. It has also been approved for listing and trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with the stock code X4L. Bitcoin Treasury Capital will continue its Bitcoin financial strategy. [PANews]</title>

      <title>British media says stablecoins are fraught with risks and may provide an opportunity for money launderingOn July 20, according to the Financial Times, US President Trump signed the Stablecoin Regulatory Act on the 18th. This is the first stablecoin legislation in the United States at the federal level. However, the development of stablecoins has hidden risks and how it will reshape the financial ecosystem. The cross-border flow of funds in stablecoins is anonymous, making it difficult for regulators to effectively track the flow of funds and accurately count the scale of funds. This provides opportunities for illegal financial activities such as money laundering, greatly increasing the difficulty of supervision. In countries and regions with weak financial systems, the widespread use of stablecoins will inevitably have a strong impact on the local financial system. Once a stablecoin crisis occurs, it is very easy to trigger a chain of market confidence crises, which in turn leads to the outbreak of bank runs. [PANews]</title>
