      <title>Multiple Senators on the US Senate Banking Committee Release Draft for Discussion on Crypto Market StructureAccording to cryptocurrency reporter Eleanor Terrett, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Senator Cynthia Lummis, Senator Bill Hagerty, and Senator Bernie Moreno have jointly released the long-awaited draft for discussion on the crypto market structure. The draft was originally scheduled to be released last week but was delayed due to internal disputes in the House of Representatives. Building on the already passed House&apos;s CLARITY Act and the Lummis-Gillibrand Act, the draft proposes new regulations in areas such as token classification, regulatory decentralization, banking, information disclosure, and illicit finance.

According to official sources, this is the first time a self-custody crypto wallet has been embedded in a mainstream communication platform in the U.S. market. (CNBC) [Odaily News]</title>

      <title>Solana validator Somos Axolotl launches Web3-powered conservation in Mexico CityA nonprofit called Somos Axolotl has launched a conservation effort that taps into the Solana community. Crypto ecosystem has a long history of charitable and conservation aims. One such project, Solana (SOL) validator Somos Axolotl, has recently started a conservation initiative in Mexico City, aimed at protecting the endangered Axolotl. Centered around the historic area of Xochimilco, the project combines public sculpture, conservation, and community outreach with the crypto community. Its goal is to restore the habitat for the iconic, but endangered, Axolotl amphibian in the Xochimilco canal system. The project will also use its funds to promote regenerative agriculture for local residents and promote economic opportunity. What is more, all of the funds for the project will come from operating a Solana validator node. Supporters among Solana holders can help the project by staking their SOL with the Somos Axolotl validators. They receive staking rewards, just as with any validator, while also contributing to Axolotl conservation. Notably, Somos Axolotl is currently the only non-profit validator on the Solana blockchain. Interestingly, Solana validator nodes offer a unique opportunity for non-profit groups. Specifically, running validator nodes has high fixed costs of operation. However, once the node is set up, it is very scalable, meaning that it can service a large number of stakers. At the same time, revenues for a validator increase linearly with the amount of SOL staked with them. This means that a large validator can operate at high profit margins, while offering the same service as smaller ones. For this reason, if a validator manages to attract users through a charitable or conservation initiative, it gains a competitive edge against for-profit validators. For this reason, it is possible that more and more non-profits will join the Solana ecosystem, helping secure its network and making it more decentralized.</title>

      <title>Powell said nothing about monetary policy in his latest meeting speechFederal Reserve Chairman Powell delivered a welcome speech at a regulatory conference today, but as expected, he did not make any controversial or news-making remarks. Powell did not give any monetary policy hints in his brief pre-prepared speech, nor did he mention the pressure from the Trump administration. This is not surprising, as Federal Reserve officials are in a &quot;quiet period&quot; before the July 29-30 meeting and are not allowed to make public comments on interest rates and the economy. However, he said he welcomed comments on bank regulatory rules and capital issues. &quot;The Federal Reserve is a dynamic institution,&quot; Powell said. &quot;We are willing to listen to new ideas and feedback on how to improve the capital framework for large banks, and I look forward to hearing from today&apos;s participants.&quot; [PANews]</title>

      <title>Bessant: There is no reason to let Powell step down as Fed chairmanOn July 22, U.S. Treasury Secretary Benson publicly supported Federal Reserve Chairman Powell amid frequent attacks from Trump administration officials, saying he saw no reason to let him step down at this time. &quot;There is no indication that he should resign now, and his term will end in May next year,&quot; Benson said in an interview with Fox Business Channel on Tuesday. &quot;If he wants to stick to it, I think he should do it. If he wants to leave early, I think he can.&quot; For months, Powell has been criticized by Trump because he led the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged, worried about the inflationary impact of the government&apos;s tariff hikes. This month, some Republicans also raised objections to Bernanke over a costly plan to renovate the Federal Reserve building. On Monday, Benson called for an internal review of the Fed&apos;s non-monetary activities, including renovation projects. &quot;There is a real opportunity for him now, and that&apos;s where his legacy lies - to rationalize the Fed&apos;s non-monetary policy functions,&quot; Benson said.
