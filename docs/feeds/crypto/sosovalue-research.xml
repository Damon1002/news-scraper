      <title>South Korean Police Arrest 60-Year-Old Suspect in ₩84.00B Ponzi Scheme While on ProbationAccording to Yonhap News Agency, the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crime Investigation Unit of the Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency in South Korea announced on the 25th that they have arrested a 60-year-old suspect, Mr. A, on suspicion of running an 84.00 billion KRW Ponzi scheme during his probation period, and transferred six accomplices to the prosecution. From October 2020 to January 2022, Mr. A and others held project presentations on AI, cryptocurrencies, and other topics in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and attracted more than 2,200 investors with the promise of &quot;300% returns on investment,&quot; defrauding them of 84.00 billion KRW. They used funds from new investors to pay &quot;dividends&quot; to early investors, perpetrating the scheme. This individual was previously sentenced to eight months in prison with a two-year suspended sentence for fraud in July 2021. Police remind the public to be especially vigilant about investment projects claiming high returns, especially those involving AI or cryptocurrencies, to avoid falling into Ponzi schemes.
