      <title>TD Cowen: Strategy premium is reasonable, Bitcoin holdings are expected to be close to 900,000 in 2027On July 22, The Block reported that TD Cowen stated that Strategy&apos;s (MSTR) premium is reasonable. After Strategy increased its holdings by 6,220 bitcoins last week, the number of bitcoins corresponding to each MSTR share increased by 20.8% from the beginning of the year. TD Cowen reiterated its $680 target price and expects the company to hold nearly 900,000 bitcoins by 2027. The report pointed out that Strategy continued to fund Bitcoin purchases by issuing new preferred shares, &quot;stretching&quot; and forming a capital flywheel effect. Analysts believe that the company continues to increase its holdings of Bitcoin through low-cost financing, and the number of Bitcoins per share continues to increase. This &quot;intrinsic&quot; premium is expected to continue for a long time, or even expand further. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Institutions: Dollar may fall further as US economic growth slowsInsight Investment analyst Francesca Fornasari said in a report that the dollar may weaken further in the second half of 2025 as U.S. economic growth slows. She said that economic weakness could pave the way for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The dollar&apos;s continued decline as the world&apos;s reserve currency will also put pressure on the dollar. However, given the uncertainty of the U.S. policy outlook and the current aggressive short bets against the dollar, the dollar&apos;s decline should be gradual and moderate.

      <title>More Public Companies Turn to Bitcoin This Week As Corporate Adoption RisesCorporate Bitcoin adoption is gaining momentum, as more publicly listed companies worldwide are shifting their treasury strategies from cash to digital assets. Although investor sentiment varies, the overall market is witnessing growing institutional alignment with Bitcoin as a reserve and strategic asset. Bitcoin Adoption Accelerates as Firms Embrace BTC MicroStrategy (MSTR) remains a notable leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption . The firm recently announced plans to issue 5.00 million Series A STRC preferred shares to raise capital for additional BTC purchases . The capital is intended for working capital needs and explicitly aligns with a long-term Bitcoin reserve strategy . Beyond MicroStrategy, other companies are actively adopting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. US-listed Profusa secured a $100.00 million equity credit line to build a Bitcoin reserve. Similarly, EV startup Volcon acquired over 280 BTC and completed a $500.00 million private funding round to support further accumulation. In Europe, Swedish-listed H100 Group increased its holdings to over 510 BTC after purchasing an additional 140 BTC. Perhaps the most symbolic move comes from Grupo Murano, a major real estate conglomerate in Mexico, which declared Bitcoin a “core strategic asset” with an initial investment of $1.00 billion. This shows a growing corporate consensus that Bitcoin is more than a speculative tool—it is becoming part of global financial policy. Market Signals Support Confidence Recent data shows that public companies’ net purchases of Bitcoin reached $953.00 million last week alone, with MSTR accounting for over $700.00 million. This surge coincides with a sharp increase in Google Trends searches for “ Buy Bitcoin ,” suggesting a revival of retail interest alongside institutional momentum. Overall, corporate Bitcoin adoption reflects a broader financial paradigm shift. Bitcoin is no longer treated as a fringe or experimental asset. From tech to real estate, businesses are increasingly incorporating Bitcoin into their treasury models, not only for diversification but also as a hedge and a symbol of forward-thinking strategy.</title>

      <title>SpaceX moves $150 million in bitcoin after three-year dormancy: ArkhamOn Tuesday, Elon Musk&apos;s aerospace company SpaceX moved its crypto holdings for the first time in three years.

According to Arkham Intelligence data, SpaceX-linked wallet address &quot;15oKQ…7Jf1G&quot; moved 1,308 BTC ($150 million) to a new address &quot;bc1q8…hartf.&quot;

This marks the company&apos;s first crypto transaction since June 10, 2022, a period during which the firm regularly sent multiple batches of about 1,200 BTC to Coinbase. Between May 25 and June 10, 2022, SpaceX transferred 17,314 BTC to the cryptocurrency exchange.

SpaceX did not officially announce the crypto transaction nor reveal the reason for moving the bitcoin. The Block has reached out to the company for comments.

Following the latest transaction, SpaceX currently holds 6,977 BTC, worth $825 million, according to Arkham. Tesla, another company owned by Musk, holds 11,509 BTC ($1.36 billion).

Last month, Arkham wrote on X that Tesla and SpaceX held over $2 billion in bitcoin, which was acquired at an average price of around $32,000. &quot;Combined, Elon’s companies are up almost $1.5 BILLION on bitcoin,&quot; Arkham wrote.

Tuesday&apos;s Bitcoin movement from SpaceX coincides with accelerating mainstream adoption of bitcoin and crypto, significantly boosted by President Donald Trump&apos;s strong pro-crypto stance and recent advancements in crypto-friendly legislation. This trend has prompted numerous traditional finance firms to establish corporate bitcoin treasuries or launch crypto-infused services.

Meanwhile, Musk, a former close ally of Trump prior to their public fallout, recently announced the formation of the &quot;America Party,&quot; a new political entity aiming to challenge the two-party system. Musk stated on X that his new party would support bitcoin. [Arkham Intelligence]</title>
