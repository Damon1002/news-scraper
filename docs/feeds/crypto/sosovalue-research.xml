      <title>QCP Capital: Ethereum&apos;s performance drives the start of altcoin season, with institutions leading this round of gainsIn its market weekly report released on July 21, QCP Capital stated that multiple altcoin season indicators have exceeded 50, reaching their highest level since December of last year. Coupled with the open interest in ETH perpetual contracts jumping from $18.00B to $28.00B in a week, this marks the potential official start of altcoin season. QCP pointed out that the dominant force in this round of the cycle is institutional investors. Benefiting from the clarity in stablecoin regulatory frameworks brought about by the GENIUS Act, corporate finance departments have begun to increase their holdings of L1 public chain tokens such as ETH, SOL, XRP, and ADA, similar to the role of BTC in the fiscal allocations of Strategy and Metaplanet. If ETH obtains SEC approval for its staking spot ETF in the coming months, it may attract funds to shift from BTC ETFs to ETH, further unlocking yield potential. In fact, the daily net inflow of ETH spot ETFs last week has exceeded that of BTC for two consecutive days, showing a surge in institutional interest in ETH, and BlackRock is also confident in its staking ETH ETF. In addition, bullish call spread trading is active in the ETH options market, with large volumes of call spread positions being established for September and December expirations, highlighting the market&apos;s optimism for the fourth quarter. The current BTC market dominance has fallen from 64% to 60%, while ETH&apos;s market share has risen from 9.7% to 11.6%. If the trend continues, a new round of altcoin season may have begun. QCP stated that it will continue to monitor relevant signals and update developments as soon as possible. [Odaily]</title>

      <title>Crypto investment products see record $4.4 billion in weekly inflows, pushing year-to-date total to $27B: CoinSharesGlobal crypto investment products attracted a record $4.39 billion of inflows last week, their strongest tally since CoinShares began tracking the data in 2014, and more than the previous $4.27 billion peak logged last December after the U.S. general election, the firm&apos;s head of research, James Butterfill, wrote on Monday.

The surge — the 14th consecutive week of net buying — lifted year‑to‑date inflows to $27 billion and pushed assets under management to a new all‑time high of $220 billion. Trading activity in exchange‑traded products also hit a peak, with turnover jumping to $39.2 billion.

Market leader Bitcoin was a primary driver of last week’s flows, but Ethereum was the star and notched a 13th consecutive week of capital allocations, according to Butterfill. Funds linked to the world’s second‑largest cryptocurrency pulled in $2.12 billion, nearly double their prior weekly record of $1.2 billion and taking 2025 inflows to $6.2 billion, already eclipsing last year’s total. Bitcoin products gathered $2.2 billion, down from $2.7 billion the previous week, but still sizable enough to keep overall flows at historic levels.

The United States unsurprisingly dominated geographically with $4.36 billion of inflows to funds offered by firms like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Bitwise, while Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Australia contributed a combined $78.7 million. Brazil and Germany logged modest outflows of $28.1 million and $15.5 million, respectively.

Among other altcoins, Solana, XRP, and Sui products attracted $39 million, $36 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, signaling risk appetite beyond the crypto’s two top heavyweights.</title>

      <title>Thailand SEC proposes relaxing rules for testing crypto ICO investorsOn July 21, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand (SEC) proposed to relax the knowledge testing requirements for retail crypto investors, allowing investors who have passed the test to be exempted from repeated testing, and changing the current quarterly retesting regulations to a suitability assessment every two years. The new rules require ICO portals to conduct comprehensive suitability testing on all digital token investors to ensure that investment risks match product risks. The proposal aims to reduce the burden on investors and ICO portals while being consistent with existing securities regulatory standards. The SEC is now open for public comments, with a deadline of August 1. [PANews]</title>
