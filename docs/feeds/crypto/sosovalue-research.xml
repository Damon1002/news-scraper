      <title>Six ETF issuers submit amendments to cryptocurrency ETF physical redemption, sending a &quot;positive signal&quot; to the US SECOn July 23, according to The Block, 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Galaxy, VanEck and WisdomTree all submitted revised proposals to the US SEC on Tuesday, requesting that their spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, as well as future cryptocurrency ETFs, adopt a physical subscription and redemption mechanism. Analysts believe that this move shows that the SEC&apos;s approval attitude towards cryptocurrency ETFs is turning positive. “More positive signals, indicating that the U.S. SEC is taking positive steps and is likely working on details,” said James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg. Seyffart added that the mechanism only applies to “authorized participants” such as large Wall Street institutions and market makers — not retail traders — who can redeem their ETF shares for underlying assets.

      <title>U.S. prosecutors seek to recover $7.1 million in cryptocurrency tied to oil and gas investment fraudOn July 23, according to The Block, the U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office for the Western District of Washington has filed a civil recovery lawsuit for $7.1 million in cryptocurrencies involved in an oil and gas investment fraud case. Prosecutors accused 47-year-old Geoffrey K. Auyeung and his accomplices of deceiving investors into transferring funds to so-called &quot;crude oil tank escrow accounts&quot; and promising to make profits by leasing tank space. The investigation showed that the funds involved were transferred to 81 different accounts, of which $1.9 million was used to purchase assets such as Bitcoin, USDT, USDC and Ethereum through 19 cryptocurrency accounts. Auyeung was indicted for money laundering and other crimes in 2024, and $2.3 million in stolen money in his bank account had been seized. The prosecutor said it would speed up the recovery of funds to compensate the victims. [PANews]</title>

      <title>LetsBonk Grows Market Share to 64% on Solana Meme Token Launch PlatformOn July 23, according to The Block, the market share of LetsBonk, a Meme token launch platform based on Solana, has increased from 5% a month ago to 64% at present, while the market share of competitor Pump.fun has dropped sharply from 90% to 24% during the same period. In the past week, the LetsBonk platform issued a total of about 150,000 tokens, an increase of about 14% from the 132,000 tokens issued in the previous week. Its single-day issuance on July 18 set a new record of 26,600 tokens. In addition, LetsBonk&apos;s trading volume last Friday was about $179 million, while Pump.fun&apos;s was only $52 million. Just a month ago, LetsBonk&apos;s average daily trading volume was less than $10 million, while Pump.fun&apos;s average daily trading volume was almost 15 times that of LetsBonk. The increase in trading volume has led to an increase in fee income. Last week alone, LetsBonk generated more than $8 million in fee income. During the same period, Pump.fun&apos;s fee income was only about half of that. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Polymarket reportedly considering issuing its own stablecoin to control platform USDC reserve yieldsSources familiar with the matter reveal that the crypto prediction market platform Polymarket is evaluating the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, with the aim of controlling the revenue generated by the high reserve funds backed by Circle&apos;s USDC. Currently, the platform has not made a final decision and is also weighing a revenue-sharing agreement with Circle. Since the Polymarket ecosystem is closed, it only needs to achieve the exchange between USDC and its customized stablecoin, without facing the compliance challenges of &quot;deposit and withdrawal,&quot; making the issuance of stablecoins more feasible in terms of technology and regulation. With the recent passage of stablecoin-related legislation in the United States, issuing stablecoins has become a new profit point in the eyes of crypto companies and traditional financial institutions. During the US election last year, the betting amount on the Polymarket platform reached $8.00B, and the number of visits in May reached 15.90M. Currently, the company is seeking to return to the US market by acquiring the US exchange QCEX. Previously, Polymarket faced civil and criminal investigations for allowing US users to bet, which have now been closed. [Odaily]</title>

      <title>How GameSquare is monetizing a $38.00M Ether treasury with NFTsWhile most firms treat NFTs as marketing gimmicks, GameSquare is flipping the script, deploying them as financial instruments. Its new $10.00 million yield program transforms Ethereum-based digital assets into revenue generators, marking a risky but innovative leap in corporate crypto strategy. On July 21, GameSquare announced the expansion of its crypto treasury program to $250.00 million, including a dedicated $10.00 million allocation toward a novel NFT yield strategy. The move follows a $30.00 million purchase of Ether ( ETH ), bringing its total holdings to over 10,000 tokens. Rather than holding these assets passively, the company plans to actively deploy them across Ethereum-native DeFi protocols, using NFTs not as collectibles but as yield-bearing instruments. The strategy is backed by risk management infrastructure developed in partnership with Swiss crypto firm Dialectic. The announcement positions GameSquare among a rare breed of public companies experimenting with NFTs as functional components of corporate finance. It reflects a broader evolution in digital asset strategy, moving away from speculative balance sheet positioning toward operational capital deployment. GameSquare’s decision to focus its digital asset strategy on Ethereum signals a fundamental shift in how the company views the role of capital within a modern media business. Ethereum’s capacity to be programmed, staked, lent, or locked in smart contracts is being used as the backbone of a treasury system that does more than just store value. With $35.00 million already deployed into ETH and another $215.00 million authorized, GameSquare is treating its crypto holdings not as hedges, but as financial infrastructure. The NFT angle reveals GameSquare’s deeper play. Rather than chasing hype-driven collectibles, the company is strategically acquiring Ethereum-native digital assets that align with its gaming and media roots. By locking NFTs into DeFi protocols, GameSquare can mint yield-bearing stablecoins while retaining ownership of the underlying assets. “We are excited to be among the first public companies to include NFTs as part of a diversified digital asset strategy,” the company’s CEO, Justin Kenna, said. “This reflects the innovative approach to our treasury management initiatives. With deep experience building in-game and real-world creative environments, GameSquare is uniquely positioned to understand the cultural and economic value of these digital assets.” According to the press release, GameSquare has established a dedicated crypto investment committee reporting directly to its board, with strict controls to prevent conflicts of interest.</title>

      <title>Tesla’s futuristic diner is here, serving fries and popcorn—but where’s the Dogecoin?Elon Musk’s Tesla diner is now serving up burgers and futurism in Hollywood. However, patrons noticed the absence of Dogecoin payments, despite his earlier endorsement, turning what could’ve been a crypto milestone into a missed opportunity. The grand opening of Tesla’s long-hyped “retro-futuristic” diner in Hollywood unfolded Monday afternoon with all the usual Musk theatrics: a 4:20 p.m. unlock time, robots behind popcorn machines, and Cybertruck-shaped trays. Tesla Diner &amp; Supercharger in Hollywood, LA Open 24/7, starting now  pic.twitter.com/nISRNoV89Y The crowd, which had gathered at the Santa Monica Boulevard diner hours before opening, cheered as Tesla’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, unlocked the doors.  For Dogecoin ( DOGE ) loyalists, the fanfare rang hollow. Despite Musk’s 2022 tweet insisting DOGE payments were coming, the only currency accepted was the old-fashioned kind. When one patron approached a touch screen and placed his order, he followed up with a question: “Can I pay in Dogecoin?” “Not today,” the diner employee responded. See below. 🚨DOGE FAM MUST SEE THIS🚨 I actually went to Tesla Diner first day to ask them if they accept DOGECOIN! 👇  pic.twitter.com/3b7zeDhhsA Musk’s influence on Dogecoin’s valuation is well-documented; a single tweet from him has sent the memecoin soaring or cratering for years. His latest pivot away from crypto integration, especially at a high-profile venture blending tech and commerce, raises questions about how seriously Tesla takes digital assets. The diner’s omission of DOGE isn’t just a snub to crypto enthusiasts; it’s a missed chance to normalize cryptocurrency in everyday transactions, something Musk once championed. The Tesla diner, nestled at the intersection of electric vehicles, entertainment, and lifestyle, could have become a high-visibility proving ground for real-world crypto payments. Killing it, man! “Not today” paying with  $Doge . Not the answer we where hoping for but better then a flat out no Instead, the absence of Dogecoin underscores a widening gap between Musk’s rhetoric and implementation, particularly at a time when the digital assets sector is seeking tangible, everyday use cases. Whether this was a delay or a quiet reversal remains unclear, but in the current climate, silence on crypto can speak volumes. Meanwhile, Musk has already floated plans to expand the diner concept to major cities and Supercharger stops, contingent on its initial success. Whether he’ll keep his word and eventually accept DOGE as a payment remains to be seen.  “‘Not today’ paying with $Doge. Not the answer we where hoping for but better then a flat out no,” another observer noted on X [sic].</title>

      <title>PENGU Could Rally 38% if One Key Price Resistance BreaksAfter a strong 26% gain over the past week, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is now hovering just below a crucial resistance level. While much of the altcoin market cools down, PENGU price looks poised to break out. Only if it can push past one key wall. A deeper look at bullish strength, liquidations, and price charts shows the token might still have room to run. PENGU Bulls Are In Complete Control Even though PENGU dropped around 2% in the past 24 hours, the bulls still seem to be holding the reins. The Bull-Bear Power (BBP) index, which compares recent highs and lows to measure market strength, is currently flashing green, at around 0.0148. This level suggests buyers still have the upper hand, despite a short-term dip. For token TA and market updates : Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter  here . In simple terms, when BBP is positive, bulls are stronger than bears. And Pengu’s BBP has remained above zero since late June, even as prices hovered below key resistance. That steady strength could be a sign that any dip is just part of a cooldown before another leg up. If BBP stays positive while price climbs past resistance, it might confirm that PENGU still has momentum. But if BBP flips negative, it could warn of a deeper pullback ahead. 7-Day Liquidation Map Shows Short-Biased Setup PENGU is currently trading around $0.036. The 7-day liquidation map shows cumulative short liquidation leverage building up to $10.46 million versus $10.18 million for longs; a slight bias toward short positions. Do note that there isn’t much to choose between Longs and  Shorts , and a price push in either direction can decide the next leg for PENGU.  However, as bulls are in power and that too by a sizable margin, as established by the BBP index, the price action could impact the short positions more than the long. If the price crosses $0.039, led by bulls breaking key resistance level, and even nears $0.042, a major liquidation cluster of shorts gets triggered. That would reduce downward pressure and potentially propel the  PENGU price  to the next key price level. The liquidation map shows a build-up of short positions; if PENGU’s price moves up fast, those betting against it may be forced to buy back, pushing the price even higher. PENGU Price Action Hints at a 38% Upside Technically, the  PENGU price  has tested the 0.382 Fibonacci level near $0.039 twice and failed to break above cleanly. It now trades just under that resistance. Do note that besides the Fib extension resistance, a key resistance of $0.037 also exists. The chart uses the Trend-based Fibonacci extension tool. It connects the swing low of $0.0077 to the last swing high of $0.035 and then to the immediately retraced price level of $0.028. This tool helps chart the next price targets for a coin/token in an uptrend.  If PENGU price manages a clean breakout above $0.037, $0.039, and then $0.042 (the 0.5 Fib zone), it opens the path to $0.045 first, a 25% surge. If that breaks, the next key resistance point, or rather target, would be $0.050, the 0.786 Fibonacci level. That would be a 38% rally from current prices around $0.036. Validation for this move comes from declining bear power, building short positions, and strong chart structure. The bullish trend would get invalidated if PENGU breaks the $0.035 resistance-turned-support. Or if it continues to drop to touch the retracement zone of the Fibonacci extension: the $0.028 mark.</title>
