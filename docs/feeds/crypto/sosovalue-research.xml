      <title>$TRUMP Goes Live On TRON NetworkJuly 24, 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland - TRON DAO, a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps, announced today the official deployment of $TRUMP on the TRON blockchain. The token expansion is enabled by LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard and Stargate Finance’s user interface and liquidity transport protocol. Together, they provide a framework for cross-chain transfers of $TRUMP while maintaining a unified supply. This development positions TRON at the forefront of the evolving digital asset landscape, where real-world value transfer, speed, and accessibility are critical to mainstream growth.

The deployment of $TRUMP on TRON introduces the token to one of the most actively used blockchain networks in the world. TRON hosts over 321 million user accounts and over $20 billion in daily transfer volume, with a circulating supply of more than $80 billion in USDT on the network. Its infrastructure is optimized for high-speed and low-cost transactions, making it an ideal blockchain for a token like $TRUMP that seeks to scale across everyday use cases—from DeFi engagement to community activations and potentially real-world payments.

“TRON is built to support scale, inclusion, and real-world use,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of $TRUMP on TRON reflects our belief in giving community-powered assets a network that can help them thrive globally.”

LayerZero’s integration plays a critical role in this launch, offering secure and seamless cross-chain functionality through its Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. This allows $TRUMP to move across supported blockchains without relying on traditional bridges or wrapped assets, reducing fragmentation and increasing accessibility. Stargate Finance, a liquidity network for cross-chain transfer for assets built on top of LayerZero protocol, supports $TRUMP bridging to and from TRON, further strengthening its liquidity and multichain utility.

By bringing $TRUMP into the TRON ecosystem, TRON DAO plans to explore DeFi and payment utility to the token as they continue to champion a vision of open, scalable blockchain infrastructure that supports emerging digital assets and unlocks new channels for community and financial participation. The commitment reinforces TRON DAO’s commitment to expanding its reach through innovative, user-centric initiatives that align with the decentralized ethos of the crypto space. With the addition of $TRUMP, TRON continues to prove itself as a dynamic technology for the next generation of token-based innovation.

TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, exceeding $80 billion.

      <title>DeAgentAI ecosystem product CorrAI and Blave reach strategic cooperation to promote the democratization of quantitative tradingOn July 24, CorrAI, the core product of the DeAgentAI ecosystem, announced a strategic partnership with the institutional-level data platform Blave. The two parties will integrate institutional-level derivatives data and code-free quantitative strategy building capabilities to provide users with a one-stop solution from data insights to executable trading strategies. The position concentration analysis, advanced filters and real-time warning functions provided by the Blave platform will be directly imported into CorrAI&apos;s visual strategy builder. With the guidance of the AI assistant Corr-GPT, users can quickly create strategies using key data such as whale behavior, long and short positions, and optimize them through indicators such as Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown. The whole process does not require programming knowledge. The cooperation will also bring cross-platform benefits to users of both platforms: Blave users can access CorrAI&apos;s backtesting function through API, and CorrAI subscribers can unlock Blave&apos;s enhanced data layer. CorrAI is a quantitative trading product in the DeAgentAI ecosystem that focuses on de-FAI. It provides users with verifiable on-chain insights and intelligent strategy development capabilities through DeAgentAI&apos;s advanced multi-agent infrastructure. The product is committed to making quantitative trading more accessible to both novices and professional users, and helps users avoid common pitfalls such as overfitting through an integrated large language model. DeAgentAI is an AI Agent network infrastructure project built on multiple chain ecosystems such as Sui, BSC and BTC, with the core vision of &quot;Make AI Smarter&quot;. It is committed to empowering on-chain transactions through AI prediction and feedback mechanisms, and has currently supported more than 190 million on-chain interactions, providing a smarter and more reliable AI-driven solution for the Web3 ecosystem.
