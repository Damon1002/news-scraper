      <title>BlockSec: Unverified contract on BSC was attacked, resulting in a loss of over $600,000.00According to BlockSec monitoring, a malicious transaction targeting an unverified contract on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was discovered, resulting in losses exceeding $600,000.00. As the contract is not open source, our investigation indicates that the root cause is a lack of slippage protection. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to exploit the contract, using a fake liquidity pool to obtain TA tokens, and then selling these tokens in a legitimate pool for profit. It is recommended that users who have granted approval to this contract immediately revoke these permissions to prevent further losses. [Foresight News]</title>

      <title>US court restarts trademark lawsuit related to Yuga Labs, rules BAYC NFT is a protectable trademarkA U.S. court has reinstated Yuga Labs&apos; trademark lawsuit against conceptual artist Ryder Ripps and developer Jeremy Cahen. The court ruled that a jury must decide whether the duo&apos;s parody NFT series misled consumers. Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano said that the court found in this appeal that Yuga&apos;s BAYC NFTs are protectable trademarks and not purely a scam, and also confirmed that NFTs can be protected as &quot;goods&quot; under the Lanham Act, rejecting arguments that NFTs are too intangible to qualify for trademark protection under U.S. law.

      <title>Hong Kong to criminalize unlicensed stablecoin promotion from AugustOn July 24, according to Cointelegraph, Hong Kong will begin to implement the Stablecoin Ordinance on August 1, 2025, prohibiting the provision or promotion of unlicensed fiat-backed stablecoins (FRS) to retail investors. Violators may be fined up to HK$50,000.00 and imprisoned for six months. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a warning on Wednesday, reminding investors to stay away from unlicensed stablecoins to avoid accidentally violating the law. HKMA President Yu Weiwen said that the new regulations are aimed at bringing credibility and stability to the stablecoin industry while protecting investors from fraud and excessive speculation. Although there are currently as many as 50 companies applying for stablecoin licenses, most applications lack practical implementation plans and only a few licenses will be approved. [PANews]</title>
