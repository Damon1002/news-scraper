      <title>Matrixport: Wall Street Crypto IPO Craze May Extend Bitcoin Bull Market CycleOn July 22, according to a recent report by independent analyst Markus Thielen, as several crypto companies prepare to go public, Wall Street investment banks intend to keep Bitcoin at a high level to create a favorable market environment for the upcoming IPOs. Currently, several companies, including Circle, have submitted prospectuses, and new projects are lining up to go public almost every week. At the same time, the stock prices of crypto-related listed companies have risen sharply, with MicroStrategy up 47.00%, Coinbase up 67.00%, Robinhood up 180.00%, and Circle up as much as 597.00%. This upsurge has not only boosted market sentiment and sustained investor profits, but also rapidly increased attention and enthusiasm for crypto company IPOs, which is expected to extend Bitcoin&apos;s current bull market cycle.

      <title>Bitget Wallet has integrated the Plasma public chain and supports stablecoin payments.Bitget Wallet has announced the integration of the Layer 1 blockchain network Plasma, allowing users to directly connect to the Plasma testnet through Bitget Wallet and experience the network&apos;s low-cost, high-speed stablecoin payment environment. Bitget Wallet has a built-in &quot;Faucet,&quot; supporting the free collection of XPL test tokens for exploring the Plasma network ecosystem and interactions. XPL is the native token of the Plasma network, used to pay transaction fees and priority processing fees. During the testnet phase, XPL will be used to simulate real transactions and encourage user participation in network interaction. Officials stated that Bitget Wallet will also launch incentive activities in conjunction with Plasma ecosystem partners to further promote user growth and ecosystem expansion. Plasma is a Layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments, supporting zero Gas USDT transfers and allowing the use of USDT or BTC as network fees, while being compatible with the Ethereum development framework. The project is invested in by institutions such as Tether and is expected to become an important infrastructure for global stablecoin payments in the future. [Odaily]</title>

      <title>Capital Rush into NFT Tokens Puts PENGU’s Rally at RiskPudgy Penguins (PENGU) faces pressure amid a surge in interest in NFTs (non-fungible tokens). This move could pull capital away from the trending meme coin, potentially influencing its price. Meanwhile, investors hope for a PENGU ETF (exchange-traded fund) following Canary Capital’s March filing. PENGU Faces New Competition as NFT Tokens Attract Growing Investment Pudgy Penguins meme coin has been the center of attention for months, since Canary Capital filed for a PENGU ETF. Hype around the PENGU meme coin invigorated in late June, following Justin Sun’s move to join the huddle. Amidst the frenzy and hopes for a PENGU ETF, the token soared, with analysts projecting even more gains. However, the optimism may no longer be sustainable amid renewed interest in NFT tokens. Over the weekend, Ethereum ignited renewed interest in non-fungible tokens, unveiling the NFT Torch ahead of its 10th anniversary. With it came a frenzy of NFT buying, with a single wallet scooping 48 CryptoPunk NFTs for $8.5 million. Analysts also noted an acceleration in the purchases, causing a surge in the CryptoPunk NFT floor price. According to Shotgun, a popular user on X (Twitter), whales are showing conviction with legacy collections outperforming, suggesting the market may be rotating back to quality NFTs. Legacy NFT projects are getting heavy buys and pumps. According to data on Artemis, the NFT sector is already outperforming the broader market, rising by over 200% in the last month. Notably, the NFT sector has more than tripled the Ethereum market. Despite the euphoria around PENGU and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, CryptoPunks are leading the sector in market capitalization metrics. However, on 24-hour sales metrics, BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club face stiff competition. Capital Flows Signal Appetite for Other NFT Projects Beyond PENGU Analysts are looking for PENGU-like opportunities, with ANIME as a prospective choice. Tommy, a trader and popular user on X, highlights ANIME as the best liquid NFT beta after the token bottomed out recently. The interest in the ANIME token may be ascribed to Animecoin’s recent announcement involving a Burger King and Naruto collaboration coming to the US. While Animecoin does not have any direct affiliations with either party in the prospective partnership, it may be leveraging Burger King and Naruto to target anime fans. Meanwhile, other analysts have also highlighted DOOD as a possible next PENGU. Despite no ETF prospects for the DOOD coin, which is associated with the Doodles NFT project, analysts say it also has strong fundamentals. Notably, both DOOD and PENGU are Solana meme coins. PENGU benefits from the ETF buzz and whale buys. It also has a supply of 76.7 billion. On the other hand, its RSI (Relative Strength Index) above 80 suggests the token may be overbought. Meanwhile, DOOD’s smaller supply of 10 billion could mean bigger price potential, with its RSI suggesting still more room for further upside. Another NFT trader highlighted that Doodles NFT outperformed the DOOD token, which could bode well for the meme coin’s price.</title>

Rahul Mewawalla subsequently stated in a letter to the board of directors on July 17 that he &quot;respectfully but vehemently&quot; opposed the company&apos;s description of the events, noting that the board had publicly praised his leadership earlier this year. Previously, Mawson was sued by NYDIG&apos;s parent company Stone Ridge and its subsidiary Consensus Colocation, accusing it of unauthorized control of $30.00M worth of ASIC miners owned by NYDIG.
