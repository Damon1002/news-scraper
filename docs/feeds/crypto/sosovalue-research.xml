      <title>Matrixport: Crypto market faces short-term volatility, but overall uptrend is not overMatrixport released a chart today stating that Bitcoin&apos;s open interest has increased significantly by $6.00B in the past two weeks, and the annualized funding rate has soared to 19.00%, indicating a large number of aggressive leveraged long positions in the market. At the same time, the activity of South Korean retail investors has increased significantly, and cryptocurrency trading volume has jumped from $1.00B to $6.00B, reflecting the dominant role of retail funds in this round of market conditions. However, as prices enter a sideways phase, these highly leveraged long positions may face the risk of passive liquidation, especially after next week&apos;s FOMC meeting, when the market will enter a relatively quiet August trading period. Despite short-term volatility pressure, multiple key positives are building momentum for after the summer, and the overall upward trend in the crypto market is not over. [Odaily]</title>

However, it is worth noting that yesterday, the official Believe Twitter account praised Kled for becoming a major data platform on Solana in just three months. [Wu Blockchain]</title>

      <title>Institutions: The US economy has not declined as expected, and AI may be the main contributorAccording to foreign media analysis reports, for the second time in three years, concerns about a US economic recession have once again been refuted by reality. This time, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may be the main contributor. As generative AI enters its third year, its financial impact is no longer limited to the stock prices of chip manufacturers. The surge in data center construction and overall capital expenditure is &quot;beautifying&quot; US GDP data in a surprising way. Carlyle Group&apos;s chief investment strategist Jason Thomas pointed out that this capital expenditure is an effective reindustrialization of American companies, shifting their focus from software and intangible assets to factories, machinery, and energy investments, which is unprecedented. This has a huge impact on GDP. Thomas estimates that AI-related spending alone may have contributed one-third of the US GDP growth in the second quarter of this year. And orders in related industries are still expanding at an annual growth rate of more than 40%. [Odaily News]</title>

      <title>Pi Coin Teases a Quick 40% Burst If This One EMA Cross ConfirmsPi Coin is steady around $0.47 after the “Buy Pi” fiat on‑ramp announcement kicked price up to $0.52; the first real push in days. Two technical signals on the lower timeframe hint this may not be a one-off bounce: trend strength is back, and a second moving‑average trigger is close. Trend Strength Returns, But Needs Confirmation The Average Directional Index (ADX) on the 4‑hour chart is back above 30. That tells us the price move has strength behind it, not just random sentiment. However, the current ADX peak is lower than the last one. In plain terms, the Pi Coin price trend is there, but it is not yet stronger than the previous swing. A new ADX high, or simply keeping ADX above the mid‑20s, would firm up confidence. The 4‑hour view is prioritized here because Tuesday’s jump happened inside the day; signals show up there first before the daily chart reacts. ADX measures how strong a trend is (0 to 100). It does not say up or down, so it must be read with price action. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter  here . One EMA Trigger Still Pending The fast (20-period) Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has already crossed above the medium (50-period) EMA, and that lined up with the move from $0.45 to $0.52. The same thing happened in late June when the price ran from about $0.56 to $0.66. Back then, the fast EMA failed to clear the next slower (100-period) EMA, and the Pi Coin rally faded. That second cross is now getting close again, almost waiting to happen. If it happens this time while ADX stays firm, the odds of a bigger PI price rally improve. The 200‑period EMA (blue line) on the 4‑hour chart was briefly crossed by the price yesterday, before experiencing resistance. A clean close above it would match the price structure with momentum. EMAs weigh recent prices more than older ones, so when the shorter lines climb over the longer ones, it signals rising speed in the move. Key Pi Coin Price Levels to Watch The daily chart sets the main levels for the bigger picture. A trend‑based Fibonacci extension is used here. It links three points: the late‑June low at $0.47, the swing high near $0.66, and the mid‑July pullback to $0.42. Tuesday’s candle pushed through three Fibonacci bands in one day: 0.236 at $0.46, 0.382 at $0.49, and 0.5 at $0.51. PI Price is now pausing in the $0.46–$0.49 range. A daily close above that range opens $0.54 first (0.618) and then $0.66, the prior swing high, roughly 40% above current levels if momentum carries on and the much-awaited EMA cross finally happens. An inverted bullish hammer formed on the rebound (Tuesday candle), showing buyers stepped in near the lows. Invalidation is clear: a close back under $0.46, ADX dropping under the mid‑20s, and the 20-period EMA failing to clear the 100-period line would likely send Pi Coin’s price back toward $0.42.</title>

      <title>DogeOS proposes to enable ZKP native verification capabilities on the Dogecoin network by introducing new opcodesOn July 23, according to CoinDesk, Dogecoin&apos;s ecological application development layer DogeOS officially submitted a technical proposal to Dogecoin Core, intending to implement zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) native verification function through a new opcode (OP_CHECKZKP). The upgrade will support off-chain applications such as Rollup and smart contracts, while maintaining the lightweight and high-speed characteristics of the main chain. The proposal adopts a modular design, and the first version supports Groth16 proof verification, and old version nodes can be compatible. To avoid performance risks, it is initially set that only one zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used for each script and only five zero-knowledge proofs can be used for each block. DogeOS simultaneously develops a zk virtual machine compatible with EVM, allowing Ethereum native applications to run directly on Dogecoin infrastructure. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Merlin Founder: 2.0 Upgrade Officially Released, Aiming to Create &quot;Yield-Generating and Tradable&quot; BTCIn an exclusive interview with Odaily, Jeff, the founder of the Bitcoin Layer2 project Merlin Chain, stated that the Merlin 2.0 upgrade plan has been officially released. This version will focus on &quot;BTC&apos;s yield-generating and cross-chain trading capabilities,&quot; aiming to upgrade Bitcoin from a single store-of-value asset to an on-chain currency with profitability and liquidity. Jeff pointed out that Merlin Chain&apos;s core goals in the future will revolve around two directions: first, to enhance the practicality of BTC, making it available for multi-chain interaction, DeFi investment, and asset trading; and second, to lower the barriers for retail and institutional investors to enter the BTC ecosystem, so that BTC can not only outperform the market but also participate in new narratives and new projects, capturing higher potential returns. He also revealed that Merlin will continue to optimize the BTCfi ecosystem, expand AI-driven chain abstraction technology, and launch a series of user-friendly products in the next stage to promote BTC as a true &quot;universal currency&quot; on the chain.

      <title>Trump-linked World Liberty Financial buys over 3,400 ETH for $13.00 million, onchain data showsWorld Liberty Financial, a crypto project linked to U.S. President Donald Trump, spent millions to acquire more Ethereum on Tuesday as the cryptocurrency sees surging institutional demand.

Citing Arkham Intelligence data, onchain researcher Lookonchain reported that World Liberty added 3,473 ETH at an average price of $3,743 across a number of wallets during Tuesday evening. It appears to have staked some of the newly acquired ether.

The project currently owns roughly 73,616 ETH, worth about $275.9 million at current market prices, according to Lookonchain.

World Liberty&apos;s move comes amid rising institutional demand for ether. On Tuesday, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds recorded $533.9 million in net inflows, while spot bitcoin ETFs saw a net outflow of $67.9 million, according to SoSoValue data.

The Block&apos;s price page shows that ether remained flat in the past 24 hours at $3,729. However, the second-largest cryptocurrency rose 20% in the past week and 67.1% in the past 30 days.

Meanwhile, World Liberty is preparing for the upcoming unlock of its WLFI token. The team said last week that it is aiming to have WLFI to officially begin trading within the next two months.

&quot;We&apos;re targeting 6 to 8 weeks for the full awakening — strategic alignments (alliances, grand stages, smart unlocks) take time to realize full potential,&quot; the project said last week. [Lookonchain]</title>
