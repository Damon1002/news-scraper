      <title>Pyth Announces Launch of New Website, Reinforcing Vision for Global Price Data LayerPyth announces the launch of a new website, reshaping its vision for a global price data layer. Pyth believes that the acquisition of price data has always been expensive, opaque, and difficult to access, depriving users of the opportunity to build wealth fairly. Pyth aims to build a global price data layer with the advantages of low cost, anytime access, real-time efficiency, and openness and transparency, providing data from the world&apos;s top institutions and global markets to anyone with an internet connection, thereby capturing more market opportunities.

Pyth prices come directly from the source—top exchanges, market makers, and trading firms—rather than public APIs or third-party aggregators. Data is updated in milliseconds and supports 24/7 access to all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, foreign exchange, ETFs, and more. Furthermore, publishing data to Pyth is rewarded, further building the data layer into an open infrastructure.

It is reported that Pyth Network already supports 100+ blockchains and provides more than 1600+ real-time price data feeds. Under the vision of a &quot;global universal price layer,&quot; Pyth Network aims to achieve on-chain pricing for everything, while possessing the advantages of decentralization, timeliness, accuracy, security, transparency, and low cost, further becoming an important force in driving the transformation of the global financial system.

      <title>Two men suspected in New York cryptocurrency kidnapping torture case released on million-dollar bailTwo suspects, John Woeltz and William Duplessie, accused of kidnapping and abusing a Bitcoin investor in New York, were granted bail on Wednesday for $1.00M each. Despite facing charges that could lead to life imprisonment, the judge stated that the credibility of witnesses and discrepancies in the narratives of both sides in the case led to the decision to grant bail. Prosecutors allege that the two men subjected an Italian businessman to two weeks of violent coercion, including electric shocks, beatings, and death threats, with the aim of obtaining crypto assets. The defense claims that the so-called &quot;victim&quot; was not forcibly detained and submitted videos of him participating in social activities as evidence. Casa Security stated that it has tracked 30 similar incidents in the first half of 2025 alone, calling on crypto holders to strengthen their physical security. [Decrypt]</title>

      <title>Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz Predicts Bitcoin To Hit $150,000 Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told CNBC this week that he believes Bitcoin could reach $150,000 in the near term—driven by strong market momentum and favorable macro conditions. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Galaxy Digital CEO on CNBC predicts  #Bitcoin  to hit $150,000 🚀  pic.twitter.com/372in1k54y “Yeah, listen, we’re in price discovery in a lot of these things, and $150k seems to me a decent  target ,” said Novogratz during the CNBC interview.  He acknowledged that there’s been resistance along the way, noting that “we have seen sellers that have come in, right? And so it’s not a one-directional trade, there have been some sellers that have come in and slowed things down.”  Still, Novogratz believes the trend remains upward, as long as current narratives hold. “But it feels like we’re destined to go higher, as long as this narrative continues,” he added. He cautioned that a shift in interest rate expectations, particularly if former President Trump were to signal strength in the economy that negates the need for rate cuts, could alter the trajectory. “If Trump changes his mind, you know, and says, hey, we’ve done such good work, the economy doesn’t need lower rates, that would change my thesis. But until that happens, I think we’re headed towards $150k.”  This isn’t the first time Novogratz has forecasted a bullish price prediction for Bitcoin. In a June 12 CNBC interview, he  stated  that Bitcoin could one day replace gold and even reach $1,000,000. “Bitcoin has become a macro asset,” he said. “It’s just becoming institutionalized.”  JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Galaxy Digital CEO told CNBC that Bitcoin will replace gold and go to $1,000,000 🚀  pic.twitter.com/Tf831LBt1h Novogratz pointed to a weakening U.S. dollar, increased institutional adoption, and Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million as critical components of its  long-term growth . “There is no more Bitcoin,” he noted. “There have been more Bitcoins lost than will be mined for the rest of eternity.”  He argued that Bitcoin’s scarcity, coupled with its growing role in diversified portfolios alongside gold and silver, is pushing it closer to mainstream acceptance. “The bull case becomes that over time, gold slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin,” said Novogratz. “So that is $1,000,000 a Bitcoin just to be where gold is.” [Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz]</title>
