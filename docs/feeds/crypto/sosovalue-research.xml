      <title>EigenLayer introduces multi-chain verification on Base, enabling AVSs to expand beyond Ethereum L1Eigen Labs has introduced what&apos;s known as &quot;multi-chain verification&quot; — a shift in how actively validated services can operate within the EigenLayer ecosystem. Previously restricted to Ethereum&apos;s Layer 1, AVSs can now deploy across multiple chains, including Layer 2 networks, through an integration process.

This allows services on top of EigenLayer to operate on Layer 2 networks and other blockchains while retaining the platform&apos;s security properties.

EigenLayer enables users to re-stake ETH, including through liquid staking tokens, to secure third-party applications called actively validated services (AVSs). The project&apos;s shared security layer reallocates staked ETH across multiple services beyond Ethereum.

The update enables AVSs to configure a limited set of contract parameters, making them operational on Layer 2s within hours. This flexibility is intended to help AVS developers reduce costs, improve performance, and reach users on chains that offer faster and cheaper execution environments. As a result, AVSs will be able to serve users on faster, cheaper Layer 2s.

Eigen Labs said the feature preserves the trust and security guarantees of EigenLayer, even across different networks.

Multi-Chain Verification is now available on the Base Sepolia testnet. Eigen Labs noted that a full mainnet launch and support for more chains are expected in the coming months, with general availability targeted for the third quarter.

Last month, Eigen Labs introduced EigenCloud, a unified, programmable environment that combines core services such as EigenDA for data, EigenVerify for dispute resolution, and EigenCompute for execution.

This coincided with venture firm a16z crypto purchasing $70 million worth of EIGEN tokens, expanding on its previous lead investment in Eigen Labs&apos; $100 million series B round.</title>

      <title>Voltage CEO: By 2028, Lightning Network may handle at least 5% of global stablecoin transactionsOn July 25, according to Cointelegraph, Graham Krizek, founder and CEO of Voltage, a Lightning Network payment service provider, said in an interview that with the popularity of the Layer 2 network, by 2028, the Lightning Network will handle at least 5% of the world&apos;s stablecoin transactions. He said that stablecoins will accelerate the popularity of the Lightning Network because it is the best expansion tool for stablecoins, and the network&apos;s stablecoin transactions may reach billions of dollars. At present, there are few stablecoin trading activities on the Lightning Network, but the situation may change soon. &quot;Stablecoins have just entered the Lightning Network, and major participants such as Tether have not yet been launched. The transaction volume accounts for almost zero, but it will grow in the second half of this year.&quot; Tether announced in January this year that it will launch USDT that supports the native Lightning Network. Changes may have begun since then. [PANews]</title>

      <title>In the past 12 hours, 14,273 BTC suspected to be from a &quot;Fossil Hand Whale&quot; were recharged to major exchanges in batches by Galaxy Digital.On July 25, according to the monitoring of on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa, 14,273 BTC suspected to belong to the &quot;14-year BTC holder&quot; were recharged by Galaxy Digital in batches to major exchanges (about 1.67 billion US dollars) in the past 12 hours, of which 5,690 BTC were transferred in the past hour. Two sets of data show that this time there is a high probability that they are really selling: Binance BTC spot trading has traded more than 10,000 in 4 hours; Galaxy Digital has withdrawn some USDT from the exchange after recharging BTC. At noon today, Galaxy has withdrawn 200.00 million USDT from Binance and OKX, and then distributed 140.00 million of them to 5 new addresses. It should be that some of them are being sold and sorted out. At present, Galaxy still holds 33,763 BTC (about 3.90 billion US dollars) on the chain. Subsequently, the analyst released an update saying that the seven new addresses that received USDT should be Coinbase recharge addresses, and a total of 200.00 million USDT tokens have been recharged into hot wallets. It seems that the “Fossil Hand Whale” has chosen to settle at Coinbase. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Hong Kong’s OSL Group secures $300 million in equity funding to fuel global expansionHong Kong-based OSL Group has secured $300.00 million in equity financing to support its global expansion.

In a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, OSL said that it has entered into an equity purchase agreement to raise approximately HK$2,355.00 million ($300.00 million).

The company said it plans to use the proceeds to fuel global expansion through strategic acquisitions. OSL also intends to use the newly raised capital for the development of payment initiatives that integrate fiat currencies, stablecoins, and major cryptocurrencies.

&quot;This $300.00 million equity raise marks a major milestone in our journey and reflects strong conviction in OSL’s digital asset strategy and execution,&quot; said Ivan Wong, chief financial officer of OSL Group. &quot;The funding will accelerate our global buildout — particularly in regulated payment infrastructure and access points.&quot;

OSL&apos;s latest funding move comes as Hong Kong&apos;s new stablecoin licensing regime is expected to take effect on Aug. 1. The upcoming framework mandates licensing from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins.

Global expansion appears to be at the forefront of OSL&apos;s agenda. Last month, OSL announced a $15.00 million deal to acquire Evergreen Crest, the operator of a cryptocurrency exchange in Indonesia. In February, the company completed its acquisition of the Japanese crypto exchange CoinBest and renamed it OSL Japan.

OSL&apos;s stock fell 7.40% in Hong Kongas of Friday, according to Yahoo Financedata, with the market still open. The stock, however, has risen 14.00% over the past month and 104.00% year-to-date.</title>

      <title>WOO X: The attack was caused by a phishing attack on a team member&apos;s device, which gave the attacker access to the development environmentOn July 25, cryptocurrency trading platform WOO X released an update on the X platform saying that the attack originated from a team member&apos;s device being hacked in a targeted phishing attack, allowing the attacker to access the development environment. Although multiple security measures restricted access rights, it still gave the attacker time to coordinate a series of withdrawal operations from the user account mentioned in the previous message. The team is conducting a comprehensive forensic review and is prioritizing the reopening of withdrawal services for all users. Once the relevant work is completed, the progress will be updated here immediately. Previously, WOO X said that the attack has caused a loss of $14.00 million and promised to fully compensate the affected users. [PANews]</title>
