      <title>Binance will accept Circle&apos;s stablecoin USYC as collateral for institutional clientsCircle announced that Binance will begin accepting USYC, a stablecoin that shares yields with investors, as collateral for institutional clients. While many institutional traders using platforms like Binance would use Bitcoin or other crypto assets as collateral, some traditional institutions are still reluctant to do so. Catherine Chen, Head of Binance VIP and Institutional Business, said that part of the reason is that the dismal collapse of FTX has made many wary of providing collateral on exchanges. Binance is trying to address this issue through a service called &quot;Banking Triparty.&quot; This service involves Binance partnering with traditional banks to act as custodians and using assets held by the banks as collateral for cryptocurrency trading. She added that many partners are working with Binance to integrate USYC, which will provide faster settlement speeds. Binance also announced that it will integrate another yield-bearing stablecoin, cUSDO. cUSDO is short for OpenEden OpenDollar and is issued by OpenEden Digital, a Bermuda-licensed and regulated entity.

      <title>deBridge launches Reserve Fund to buy back its DBR token with all protocol revenuedeBridge Foundation, the organization behind the popular bridge protocol, has unveiled a Reserve Fund that channels 100% of protocol revenue into open market purchases of its DBR token, part of an effort to establish long-term value and provide users with a line-of-sight into more than $30 million in DAO assets.

Since going live in June, the Reserve Fund has already acquired 1.3% of DBR’s total supply of 10 billion tokens, currently valued at nearly $3 million, the project informed The Block. The fund now sits alongside deBridge’s broader treasury, which holds $30.1 million across DBR, USDC, SOL, and ETH as of July 24, according to details shared by the foundation.

The initiative is also exploring yield-bearing strategies to increase the fund’s overall value. According to the project, Idle USDC stablecoins on Ethereum are deposited into lending protocol Aave, while ETH is staked via Lido’s platform. On Solana, SOL and native USDC are deployed on Kamino Finance to earn returns. A public dashboard has also been released, tracking every purchase, balance, and real-time yield, providing the community with an on-chain audit trail of the foundation’s balance sheet.

DBR is the native governance token of the deBridge protocol, which was introduced in late 2024 and issued on the Solana blockchain as an SPL token. Launched in early 2022, deBridge operates as a cross-chain liquidity transfer solution that connects multiple networks like Solana, Ethereum, and BNB Chain. It doesn’t require users to lock assets and receive an equivalent wrapped token, a popular bridging design regularly exploited by cybercriminals.

deBridge raised $5.5 million in funding from investors, including Animoca Brands and ParaFi Capital, back in 2021. According to DefiLlama data, deBridge has nearly $10 million in annualized fees, and its DBR coin has a market capitalization of over $80 million.

The buyback model echoes recent moves by dYdX, Pump.fun, Raydium, and other decentralized platforms that use protocol revenue to burn or accumulate native tokens in a bid to tie value directly to network activity and support ecosystem growth.</title>

      <title>Solana developers are considering increasing network block capacity by 66%.As demand for block space grows, Solana developers are considering increasing the network&apos;s block capacity by 66%. According to a document released by core contributors this week, the new proposal SIMD-0286 proposes increasing the upper limit of compute units (CU) per Solana block from 60.00M to 100.00M. The proposal aims to allow Solana to handle more transactions and support more complex applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), MEV systems, and restaking protocols, without hitting the compute limit.
