      <title>$1 Trillion Capital Is All It Takes for Bitcoin to Hit $1 Million | US Crypto NewsWelcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab your coffee and settle in because the numbers behind Bitcoin’s future are starting to get serious. As global liquidity surges and the pace of money creation accelerates, some investors believe we are entering a new phase for the pioneer crypto. Crypto News of the Day: Bitcoin Hitting $1 Million Seen as Inevitable with Global Money Supply Set to Double In a recent US Crypto News publication, Davinci Jeremie urged viewers to spend just a dollar to buy Bitcoin. According to the Bitcoin maxi, BTC price could reach $500,000 per coin before 2030. Now, a growing number of analysts believe Bitcoin could go well beyond $500,000, ultimately reaching $1 million. This, they say, may be inevitable. Analysts point to a macroeconomic backdrop that heavily favors Bitcoin, citing surging global liquidity and the money supply, which is on track to double in the next decade. The sentiment echoes broader concerns about monetary debasement, especially as global central banks maintain loose fiscal policies and governments continue large-scale deficit spending. In the past year, the money supply has grown at its fastest pace in recent history, adding credence to the Bitcoin bull case. According to River, a Bitcoin-focused platform, anyone who has held Bitcoin since July 2024 has outperformed against money debasement tenfold. That outperformance reinforces Bitcoin’s positioning as a hedge against fiat dilution, particularly in an environment of rising global debt and systemic liquidity injections. Further supporting the bullish thesis, global M2 money supply per Bitcoin has reached a 12-year high. This liquidity-to-scarcity ratio reflects just how little capital is needed, in relative terms, to send Bitcoin dramatically higher. With only 21 million BTC coins ever existing, and significantly fewer in active circulation, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it increasingly responsive to institutional or sovereign capital inflows.

      <title>Wu Blockchain Daily Crypto News Roundup - Western Union Explores Integrating Stablecoin Services1. Western Union Explores Integrating Stablecoin ServicesWestern Union CEO Devin McGranahan stated that the company is exploring launching stablecoin services in its digital wallet and plans to establish cooperation channels for buying and selling stablecoins. He pointed out that stablecoins have great potential in accelerating cross-border transfers, improving the efficiency of fiat currency exchange, and providing a means of storing value for countries with unstable economies.2. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Accused of Perjury Twice, Congressman Requests Criminal ReferralU.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna submitted a criminal referral request to the Department of Justice, accusing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of twice committing perjury in testimony and written statements regarding the Fed building renovation project. The incident occurred as conservatives continue to pressure Trump to replace Powell as soon as possible, but Trump said it is currently &quot;highly unlikely&quot; to remove him from office.3. South Korea to Advance &quot;Virtual Currency Short Selling&quot; Legislation, Plans to Introduce Stock Market-Level RegulationSouth Korean financial regulators plan to introduce regulatory standards equivalent to those of the stock market for token lending services provided by the country&apos;s crypto exchanges. Currently, Bithumb offers token lending services up to 400% of the collateral value, while Upbit offers Bitcoin lending services up to 80% of the margin. Financial authorities believe that such services are essentially equivalent to short selling transactions and are considering introducing corresponding regulatory measures in the ongoing second phase of virtual asset legislation.4. Hong Kong Customs Detects HK$1.15B Money Laundering Case Involving Virtual Assets and Cash SmugglingHong Kong Customs has detected a suspected money laundering case involving approximately HK$1.15B through cash smuggling and virtual assets, arresting a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man. Customs stated that the two men are suspected of smuggling cash out of the country and frequently using funds of unknown origin to conduct large stablecoin and fiat currency transactions, with the amounts inconsistent with their financial situation. Customs raided multiple locations today, seizing items such as phones and bank cards, and arrested the two men under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance. The case is still under investigation.5. White House&apos;s First Crypto Policy Report Expected to Be Released to the Public Before the End of the MonthThe White House&apos;s first crypto policy report will be officially submitted on July 22 (local time) and is expected to be released to the public before the end of this month. White House officials have confirmed the relevant timeline. This report is the result of months of collaboration between task force leaders David Sacks, Bo Hines, and senior officials from the Treasury Department, Department of Commerce, SEC, CFTC, and other departments, aimed at implementing President Trump&apos;s January executive order on strengthening the United States&apos; leadership in the cryptocurrency field. The report is expected to include regulatory and legislative recommendations, but the specific content is not yet clear.</title>

      <title>Ethereum Faces $1.3 Billion Unstaking Wave — Here’s What It Could Mean for ETHAs capital continues to flow strongly into Ethereum in 2025—pushing its price above $3,600—the amount of ETH queued for unstaking has also surged unexpectedly. What could this mean for Ethereum’s price trend? Here are some expert insights. Over 350,000 ETH Waiting to Be Unstaked—What’s the Implication? Udi Wertheimer, a prominent investor in the crypto community, raised concerns after discovering that more than 350,000 ETH—worth approximately $1.3 billion—are currently waiting in the unstaking queue. Unstaking allows users to withdraw their ETH from staking smart contracts, turning it back into freely usable assets. A large wave of unstaking could signal potential selling pressure. This is especially true if investors are looking to take profits after ETH’s 160% rally since its April lows. Earlier in 2024, more than 500,000 ETH were unstaked before ETH surged from $2,100 to over $4,000, and later dropped back to $2,100. Where Might This Unstaked ETH Go? Viktor Bunin, OG Protocol Specialist at Coinbase, suggested that this ETH might be moved into internal treasury funds. These funds could serve financial strategies like long-term investment or portfolio diversification. If that’s the case, this isn’t a sign of panic selling—it’s more likely a form of asset management. This could actually help stabilize the market in the long term. Meanwhile, a report from Lookonchain shows that on-chain data indicates around 23 whales or institutions have accumulated 681,103 ETH (worth $2.57 billion) since July 1. And the accumulation hasn’t stopped. In the fourth week of July, more institutions continued to add billions of dollars worth of ETH. What About ETH Being Staked? Udi Wertheimer’s concern may sound alarming, especially when compared to historical patterns. However, it lacks a key perspective: the amount of ETH currently waiting to be staked. Data from ValidatorQueue shows that the ETH queued for staking actually far exceeds the amount queued for unstaking. Since June, this queue has surged, with over 450,000 ETH waiting to be staked on certain days. This reflects continued investor interest in participating in the Ethereum network through staking. Data from beaconcha.in shows that over 35.7 million ETH is currently staked across various protocols. This accounts for 29.5% of the circulating supply . Ultimately, the balance between ETH entering and leaving staking protocols is a critical factor. It helps determine whether the market is facing real selling pressure or simply witnessing strategic reallocation by institutions and individual investors.</title>
