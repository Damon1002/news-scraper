Wu Blockchain&apos;s Macro Indicators and Analysis This Week: Powell&apos;s Speech, ECB Interest Rate DecisionAbstractLast week, the US June inflation data CPI was 2.7%, PPI was 2.3%. The Federal Reserve&apos;s latest Beige Book showed that the overall outlook was neutral to slightly pessimistic, with only a few regions expecting economic activity to grow. There are fewer important data indicators this week, and attention can be paid to Powell&apos;s speech at the regulatory meeting and the ECB&apos;s interest rate decision.Last Week&apos;s ReviewThe US June unadjusted CPI annual rate was 2.7%, expected 2.7%, previous value 2.40%, the highest since February.The US June PPI annual rate was 2.3%, the lowest since September 2024, expected 2.5%, previous value revised from 2.60% to 2.7%.The Federal Reserve&apos;s latest Beige Book shows that from the end of May to the beginning of July, US economic activity grew slightly, employment increased slightly, wages continued to rise moderately, and manufacturing layoffs increased slightly, but overall layoffs were still limited. All regions generally face rising raw material and insurance costs driven by tariffs, and some companies have passed some of the costs on to consumers, which may increase the risk of rising inflation in the coming months. The overall outlook is neutral to slightly pessimistic, with only a few regions expecting economic activity to grow.The number of initial jobless claims in the United States for the week ending July 12 was 221,000, expected 235,000, and the previous value was revised from 227,000 to 228,000.The US Michigan Consumer Confidence Index in July rose to 61.8, a five-month high, but still 16% lower than the end of last year. The annual inflation expectation fell from 5.0% to 4.4%, the lowest this year, and the long-term inflation expectation fell to 3.6%. The survey shows that consumer confidence is still affected by inflation concerns and policy uncertainty.US President Donald Trump announced that the United States will provide Ukraine with &quot;the most advanced weapons&quot; through NATO countries, while threatening Russia that if an agreement to end the war is not reached within 50 days, severe tariffs will be imposed on Russia.Key Events &amp; Indicators This WeekJuly 22Federal Reserve Chairman Powell delivers a welcome speech at a regulatory conference (20:30)Reserve Bank of Australia releases minutes of July monetary policy meeting (09:30)July 23US President Donald Trump delivers a speech at an event called &quot;Winning the AI Race&quot;July 24ECB announces interest rate decision (20:15)US initial jobless claims for the week ending July 19 (10,000s) (20:30)French, German, and Eurozone July Manufacturing PMI Preliminary Values [吴说]</title>

      <title>Crypto custodian BitGo joins Grayscale in confidentially filing IPO documents with SECCrypto‑custody veteran BitGo Holdings has confidentially filed a draft registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a planned initial public offering of its Class A shares, the company said on Monday, teeing up what could become another massive U.S. crypto listings after stablecoin issuer Circle listed on the New York Stock Exchange in June.

Filing IPO documents confidentially with the SEC allows firms like BitGo to keep financial specifics private while working on the offering.

The move comes amid a thaw in capital markets for digital asset operators under President Donald Trump&apos;s pro-crypto administration. Asset‑manager Grayscale Investments also submitted confidential IPO paperwork last week. Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish filed for an IPO shortly after Circle shares went live on the NYSE in early June.

Circle&apos;s IPO last month was massively successful, as the firm debuted on the NYSE at $31 per share and has risen to over $223, a 619% increase in less than a quarter, which values the company behind USDC at more than $55 billion, according to The Block&apos;s data. Furthermore, the IPO pipeline may soon expand to include other heavyweights like Kraken, Gemini, Ledger, DCG, and Ledger, to name a few, The Block&apos;s Yogita Khatri reported in last week’s The Funding newsletter.

BitGo&apos;s listing attempt marks a comeback after Mike Novogratz&apos;s Galaxy Digital scrapped a $1.2 billion deal to acquire the firm in 2022, a break‑up that led to years of litigation and forced BitGo to remain private while rivals such as Coinbase expanded.

Founded in 2013 and best known for safeguarding digital assets for exchanges, funds, and corporates, BitGo did not disclose the size of the offering or proposed price range. The company&apos;s platform reportedly has over $100 billion in assets under custody and supports more than 1,200 crypto tokens, according to its website. It also counts clients such as Nike’s RTFKT Studios, Pantera Capital, and dozens of spot‑ETF issuers.

The IPO will proceed &quot;after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,&quot; the company said.

      <title>TON narrowly avoids blockchain crash: ‘Security remains highest priority’TON blockchain security firm TonBit announced that it averted a major vulnerability on the TON Virtual Machine. TON blockchain (TON) averted a total crash after discovering a major bug. On Monday, July 21, TonBit announced that it identified a critical vulnerability in the TON Virtual Machine. According to TonBit, the bug could have led to denial-of-service attacks across the network, bringing its infrastructure down. The bug in the INMSGPARAM instruction for the TVM included a null-pointer dereference that could have been used to inject false message parameters. Attackers could exploit this behavior to crash the virtual machine at runtime. In the case of such an exploit, the network would halt its execution of smart contracts and disrupt dApps operating on TON. This would significantly affect the large miniapp ecosystem on Telegram, many of which rely on TON for their infrastructure. TonBit discovered the vulnerability ahead of the rollout of Global Version 11. This enabled maintainers to quietly integrate the fix before the mainnet deployment of the update. For its efforts, TonBit earned a bug bounty from the TON Core development team. This was the third time that the security firm obtained a similar reward, with formal recognition from the TON team. In both cases, the team delivered patches before bad actors were aware of the vulnerabilities. “Ensuring the security and robustness of the TON ecosystem remains our highest priority,” said Paul Li, Co-founder of TonBit. “By continuously probing the deepest layers of TVM and working hand‑in‑hand with the TON Core team, we not only protect users today but also build the foundation of trust necessary for tomorrow’s decentralized applications.” Owned by BitsLab, TonBit is a security firm focusing on the TON ecosystem. The firm is a primary security assurance provider for the network, and specializes in comprehensive audits for TON-based projects.</title>
