      <title>Ethereum hits 45 million block gas limit in latest scaling moveEthereum, the world&apos;s second-largest blockchain by market capitalization, saw its gas limit spike to 45 million units — a 25% rise from its previous level of 36 million, set in February 2025.

Nearly 50% of validators — representing close to 500,000 staked ETH addresses — signaled support for the increase, and the gas limit hike was activated at block number 22,968,004.

This development, driven by strong community support, marked a step toward improving the network&apos;s transaction scaling capacity. The gas limit, which caps the computational effort allowed per block on Ethereum&apos;s blockchain, determines the number of transactions and smart contracts that can be processed simultaneously.

An increase in the block gas limit enables each block to process more data, allowing the network to handle a higher volume of transactions. Unlike major protocol upgrades, this change does not require a hard fork. Validators can adjust their node configurations when proposing blocks. Once more than 50% of validators signal support, the block gas limit adjusts automatically.

The gas limit was previously capped at 30 million but was raised to 36 million in February. The prior adjustment occurred in 2021, when it doubled from 15 million to 30 million units.

The push to 45 million is part of Ethereum&apos;s broader scaling roadmap, with validators aiming for a 60 million block gas limit target in the short term and a long-term goal of 150 million gas per block — potentially achievable through the upcoming Fusaka hard fork via Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7935.

To mitigate risks, developers have introduced safeguards, such as EIP-7983, which caps individual transaction gas usage at 16.77 million units to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and maintain network stability.</title>

      <title>BNB Chain Foundation Acquires TAG Data Labeling Platform CoinOn-chain data shows that the BNB Chain Foundation address purchased $25,000.00 worth of TAG tokens today. Tagger (TAG) is a data labeling platform on the BNB Chain that implements an automated business model for the AI data industry in a DeCorp model. Previously, Tagger was one of the winning projects in the USD1 competition held by World Liberty Financial, and received a strategic purchase of a total of $240,000.00 worth of TAG tokens from WLFI and BUILDon. Recently, Tagger announced that it will officially adopt the USD1 stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial as the settlement method for Web 2 customer enterprise data orders. At the same time, Tagger also plans to distribute some real-time task rewards to data labelers on the platform in USD1 form in the future. Tagger will showcase the many advantages of the USD1 stablecoin payment system in real-world AI enterprise-level B2B settlement, such as real-time cross-border transfers, extremely low handling fees, conversion of DeFi revenue into business discounts, and collateralized lending facilities during the order settlement process.

      <title>Sources: Bank of Japan expected to stick to gradual rate hike stance after Ishiba&apos;s Upper House election lossAccording to sources, Bank of Japan officials believe there is little need to change their stance on gradually raising interest rates after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba&apos;s setback in the Upper House election. Although officials will continue to closely monitor the government&apos;s fiscal policy, they still believe that continuing to raise the benchmark interest rate is appropriate if the economic outlook is as expected. Sources said the Policy Board, led by Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, is likely to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.50% at its meeting next week. Given that trade negotiations between Japan and the United States are still ongoing, officials want to assess the impact of the agreement on inflation trends and the economic outlook before raising interest rates again. Sources said that while the election results will not change the Bank of Japan&apos;s policy path at present, some officials believe that it is necessary to be wary of the upside risks to inflation that may result from a significant easing of fiscal policy. Officials have noted that inflation risks are rising as soaring food prices such as rice push up price increases more than expected. (Golden Ten) [Odaily Planet Daily News]</title>

      <title>JPMorgan Chase explores lending secured by clients’ cryptocurrencies: FTJPMorgan Chase is exploring plans to offer loans secured by customers’ cryptocurrency holdings, signaling a broader embrace of crypto assets by traditional financial institutions.

FT reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the bank is weighing plans to allow clients to borrow against crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether as early as next year, though the details remain subject to change.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has consistently expressed skepticism toward Bitcoin, but in May he acknowledged that the bank would facilitate client access to the cryptocurrency — though it does not plan to offer custody services.

According to the FT article, JPMorgan has already taken preliminary steps into the crypto sector, including plans to offer loans against crypto exchange-traded funds.

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has repeatedly reaffirmed his negative stance on Bitcoin but acknowledged in May that the bank would work to allow clients to buy Bitcoin. In May, — but it will not keep custody.

The Block has reached out to JPMorgan for further comment.

The bank&apos;s move comes amid crypto-friendly regulatory shifts in the U.S., with President Donald Trump signing the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin bill, last week.

The GENIUS bill would establish a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, requiring them to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or other highly liquid assets. It would also mandate annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization exceeding $50 billion and establish rules for issuance by foreign entities. [Financial Times]</title>

      <title>Matrixport: Wall Street Crypto IPO Craze May Extend Bitcoin Bull Market CycleOn July 22, according to a recent report by independent analyst Markus Thielen, as several crypto companies prepare to go public, Wall Street investment banks intend to keep Bitcoin at a high level to create a favorable market environment for the upcoming IPOs. Currently, several companies, including Circle, have submitted prospectuses, and new projects are lining up to go public almost every week. At the same time, the stock prices of crypto-related listed companies have risen sharply, with MicroStrategy up 47.00%, Coinbase up 67.00%, Robinhood up 180.00%, and Circle up as much as 597.00%. This upsurge has not only boosted market sentiment and sustained investor profits, but also rapidly increased attention and enthusiasm for crypto company IPOs, which is expected to extend Bitcoin&apos;s current bull market cycle.

      <title>Capital Rush into NFT Tokens Puts PENGU’s Rally at RiskPudgy Penguins (PENGU) faces pressure amid a surge in interest in NFTs (non-fungible tokens). This move could pull capital away from the trending meme coin, potentially influencing its price. Meanwhile, investors hope for a PENGU ETF (exchange-traded fund) following Canary Capital’s March filing. PENGU Faces New Competition as NFT Tokens Attract Growing Investment Pudgy Penguins meme coin has been the center of attention for months, since Canary Capital filed for a PENGU ETF. Hype around the PENGU meme coin invigorated in late June, following Justin Sun’s move to join the huddle. Amidst the frenzy and hopes for a PENGU ETF, the token soared, with analysts projecting even more gains. However, the optimism may no longer be sustainable amid renewed interest in NFT tokens. Over the weekend, Ethereum ignited renewed interest in non-fungible tokens, unveiling the NFT Torch ahead of its 10th anniversary. With it came a frenzy of NFT buying, with a single wallet scooping 48 CryptoPunk NFTs for $8.5 million. Analysts also noted an acceleration in the purchases, causing a surge in the CryptoPunk NFT floor price. According to Shotgun, a popular user on X (Twitter), whales are showing conviction with legacy collections outperforming, suggesting the market may be rotating back to quality NFTs. Legacy NFT projects are getting heavy buys and pumps. According to data on Artemis, the NFT sector is already outperforming the broader market, rising by over 200% in the last month. Notably, the NFT sector has more than tripled the Ethereum market. Despite the euphoria around PENGU and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, CryptoPunks are leading the sector in market capitalization metrics. However, on 24-hour sales metrics, BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club face stiff competition. Capital Flows Signal Appetite for Other NFT Projects Beyond PENGU Analysts are looking for PENGU-like opportunities, with ANIME as a prospective choice. Tommy, a trader and popular user on X, highlights ANIME as the best liquid NFT beta after the token bottomed out recently. The interest in the ANIME token may be ascribed to Animecoin’s recent announcement involving a Burger King and Naruto collaboration coming to the US. While Animecoin does not have any direct affiliations with either party in the prospective partnership, it may be leveraging Burger King and Naruto to target anime fans. Meanwhile, other analysts have also highlighted DOOD as a possible next PENGU. Despite no ETF prospects for the DOOD coin, which is associated with the Doodles NFT project, analysts say it also has strong fundamentals. Notably, both DOOD and PENGU are Solana meme coins. PENGU benefits from the ETF buzz and whale buys. It also has a supply of 76.7 billion. On the other hand, its RSI (Relative Strength Index) above 80 suggests the token may be overbought. Meanwhile, DOOD’s smaller supply of 10 billion could mean bigger price potential, with its RSI suggesting still more room for further upside. Another NFT trader highlighted that Doodles NFT outperformed the DOOD token, which could bode well for the meme coin’s price.</title>
