      <title>JPMorgan Chase Believes Prediction of Stablecoin Market Cap Increasing to $2 Trillion is &quot;Slightly Optimistic&quot;According to The Economic Times, JPMorgan Chase believes that the often-mentioned prediction that the stablecoin market could grow to $2.00T is &quot;slightly optimistic&quot; in the recent push for the first approval of cryptocurrency market regulation legislation in the United States. Currently, the market capitalization of all stablecoins is approximately $260.00B. JPMorgan Chase stated, &quot;We find it hard to believe that the market can grow significantly in the coming years, as the infrastructure/ecosystem supporting stablecoins is far from developed and will take time to build.&quot; Despite the recent increase in market interest in stablecoins, they still account for less than 1% of global capital flows, indicating that this digital asset still has a long way to go in disrupting the financial system.

      <title>Hong Kong 70-Year-Old Man Falls Victim to Cryptocurrency Romance ScamA 70-year-old retired Hong Kong man received a message on WhatsApp from someone claiming to be a female neighbor, which led to a &quot;twilight romance,&quot; but he never met the person. The woman claimed to work at the Singapore Exchange and have insider information on some cryptocurrency investments, falsely claiming that he would receive substantial returns. The man transferred a total of HK$3,272,700.00 in 37 transactions to 34 bank accounts provided by the woman. It was not until the man personally went to the bank to withdraw a large sum of cash because he had reached the ATM withdrawal limit that bank staff noticed the transaction was unusual and immediately notified the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre, which finally exposed the scam. The man lost more than HK$3.27M in total and incurred nearly HK$1M in debt as a result. Hong Kong police said they had received nearly 20 online romance scams related to investment in the past two weeks, with 40% of the victims being over 60 years old, with a total loss of more than HK$10.00M.

      <title>FTX to start next creditor payout on Sep. 30 with $1.9 billion granted by courtFTX announced Wednesday that it is expected to start distributing the next batch of creditor claims on Sep. 30. The record date for claim holders is set for Aug. 15.

Its latest announcement also revealed that the bankruptcy court gave the greenlight to cut down the claims reserve from $6.5 billion to $4.3 billion, which releases $1.9 billion to be distributed to holders in the upcoming disbursement. However, it did not explicitly state how much would be allocated for the Sept. 30 distribution.

FTX has so far handed out approximately $6.2 billion to former customers across two distributions — $1.2 billion in February and $5.0 billion in May this year. The overall repayment plan aims to distribute between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion, with recoveries varying based on claim type and valuation.

Around 98% of the creditors are expected to receive at least 119% of their claims based on the value at the time of the bankruptcy. Some creditors have criticized the plan, noting that the overall crypto market has significantly appreciated in value since the bankruptcy in 2022.

The payout is expected to be made through BitGo, Kraken and Payoneer. Traders anticipate that these FTX distributions could inject significant liquidity into the crypto market, especially for altcoins.

Meanwhile, the FTX Recovery Trust submitted a motion on July 4 requesting the court to authorize the implementation of new measures to assess creditor claim distributions in restricted jurisdictions overseas.

The motion sought to immediately forfeit and reverse claims in countries designated as &quot;restricted jurisdictions,&quot; where distributions would be deemed illegal. Potentially affected countries included China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. The proposal drew backlash and formal objections from creditors in those regions.

At a hearing on Tuesday, the court acknowledged the objections to the proposed motion and ordered FTX to revise it —removing the clause that would allow for the &quot;immediate&quot; forfeiture of claims and adding an option for creditors in restricted regions to transfer and receive their claims through a different jurisdiction, according to an X post by FTX Historian.
