      <title>Bitcoin Core developers fix 5-year-old disk fill vulnerabilityOn July 21, according to Protos, the Bitcoin Core development team this month fixed a disk filling vulnerability that has plagued full node operators for five years. The vulnerability allows attackers to force node hard disks to continuously write redundant data through malicious log instructions (such as LogPrintf, LogInfo, LogWarning, or LogError, etc.), causing serious impacts on mechanical hard disk nodes and even causing performance degradation of flash memory devices.
The fix was submitted via PR 32604 and merged into the main branch by senior developer Gloria Zhao. The submission passed 19 checks and no objections. Developers expect that the disk filling attack will disappear completely after the patch is popularized in the Bitcoin network with the new version of Bitcoin Core. The latest version of Bitcoin Core is 29.0, which was released on April 14, and the Core version is usually upgraded every few months. As a voluntary software package that does not allow automatic updates, full node operators must always choose to manually upgrade their software. About 16% of node operators are running version 29.0. Other nodes are running older versions of the software. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Jack Dorsey&apos;s Bitcoin-centric Block Inc to join S&amp;P 500 this weekBlock Inc, the tech company that operates several business units in the digital asset ecosystem, will be added to the S&amp;P 500 effective Wednesday, July 23. The stock traded higher by 10% in aftermarket trading after the news was confirmed late Friday.

&quot;It’s a milestone that reflects the strength of our business and the work of thousands of people building tools to increase access to the economy, across our brands including Square, Cash App, Afterpay, TIDAL, Proto, and Bitkey,&quot; the company said in a release. &quot;Thanks to our customers, teams, and shareholders who’ve been with us on the journey. We’re just getting started.&quot;

Block (ticker XYZ) was originally founded in 2009 as Square and was initially focused on providing financial services and mobile payment solutions. In December 2021, the company rebranded to Block Inc., reflecting its growing interest and involvement in blockchain technology and digital assets.

Block&apos;s Bitkey unit is a simple self-custody wallet built for bitcoin, while Proto is a suite of bitcoin mining products and services. The addition to the S&amp;P 500 comes about two months after Coinbase became the first pure-play crypto firm to join the benchmark index. Block will replace Hess, which is exiting the index upon its acquisition by Chevron.

Last summer, Block began investing 10% of its bitcoin profits into BTC each month, and open-sourced its treasury blueprint so others can follow suit. The company owns 8,584 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net, which is worth around $1 billion at current prices. [BlockBeats]</title>

      <title>Bitcoin Treasury Capital CEO: I learned about Bitcoin while studying Chinese in ShanghaiOn July 20, Bitcoin Treasury Capital CEO Christoffer De Geer published an article on the X platform, revealing that he needed to remit money to Sweden when he was studying Chinese in Shanghai in 2013. When he was looking for alternatives, he accidentally learned about Bitcoin. As a Swede in China, he found a 12-year-old Bitcoin miner and began to learn about wallets, keys, UTXO, block browsers, and an anonymous person named Satoshi Nakamoto.
Today, Bitcoin Treasury Capital already holds 156 bitcoins and has reached an equity financing agreement of up to 200 million Swedish kronor with a group of investors. It has also been approved for listing and trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with the stock code X4L. Bitcoin Treasury Capital will continue its Bitcoin financial strategy. [PANews]</title>
