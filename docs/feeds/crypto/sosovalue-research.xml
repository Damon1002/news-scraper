      <title>Merlin Chain Releases Merlin 2.0 - &quot;Hold, Earn, Invest&quot; Reshaping BTCMerlin Chain has announced its new Merlin 2.0, proposing a development direction of &quot;Reinvent Bitcoin: Hold, Earn, Invest,&quot; aiming to expand Bitcoin from a &quot;store of value&quot; to a &quot;yield-generating, deployable core asset.&quot; Merlin 2.0 focuses on three major areas: BTCFi expansion, chain abstraction technology, and AI applications (such as Merlin Wizard), further enhancing the liquidity and utility of BTC in multi-chain ecosystems. It also lowers the barrier to entry for BTC, allowing users to participate in various investment opportunities across chains without having to exchange other assets, conveniently realizing BTC holding, yield acquisition, and liquidity participation. According to previous reports, since the mainnet launch in February 2024, Merlin Chain has promoted the rise of BTCFi, giving rise to several representative projects including Solv, Bedrock, Avalon, and Babylon, with over $3.80B in BTC cumulatively staked on the chain. Currently, the Merlin-related ecosystem contributes approximately $2.00B in BTCFi TVL, accounting for over 20.00%. [Odaily Planet Daily News]</title>

      <title>3 Warning Signs Bitcoin May Be Headed for a Cooldown This JulyBitcoin (BTC) has entered its fourth consecutive month of gains. However, it just ended the first red weekly candle of July. While many analysts believe the bullrun may not be over yet, some concerning signals have begun to emerge, hinting at a possible price correction or consolidation. After Four Months of Gains, Is Bitcoin Due for a Breather? These warning signs don’t necessarily mean Bitcoin will reverse, but they serve as early indicators that demand attention before stronger moves or major volatility occur. First, Bitcoin Whale-to-Exchange Flow data shows a significant increase in July. This metric reflects the volume of BTC large holders (whales) send to exchanges, usually implying an intention to sell. According to analyst Darkfost, in the last two market peaks, whale capital inflows exceeded $75 billion, marking the beginning of a correction or consolidation phase. Between July 14 and July 18, 2025, the figure has already reached $45 billion. This sharp rise indicates increased activity from large investors. Darkfost’s view aligns with recent on-chain observations from Lookonchain. Today, Lookonchain reported that a savvy Bitcoin whale sent 400 BTC (worth $47.1 million) to Binance to take profits, with total realized gains reaching $91.5 million. Beyond whale flows, on-chain data shows another signal: Bitcoin’s Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) in July reached a one-year high. CDD measures how long coins were held before being moved. It reflects the sentiment and behavior of long-term holders. A high CDD value suggests long-term holders are moving their coins and are likely to sell them. According to CryptoQuant, the 30-day average CDD in July surpassed 31 million, the highest since April 2024. A previous report from BeInCrypto noted that a spike in this metric often precedes major market corrections. However, on the positive side, it can also be seen as a redistribution to new investors. Finally, changes in the correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin have raised further concern. According to Alphractal, the Altcoin-Bitcoin Correlation Heatmap recently dropped below zero. This shift means that altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in recent days. However, historical data shows that a low correlation between Bitcoin and altcoins is often a red flag. Since the start of 2025, this indicator has turned negative thrice. The first was in January, followed by a drop in Bitcoin’s price from $110,000 to $74,900. The second time was in May, when BTC fell from $112,000 to $98,500. Now, we are seeing the third occurrence. A recent report from BeInCrypto also highlighted another concerning signal. The Coinbase Premium has decoupled from the Kimchi Premium. This disconnection suggests an uneven bullrun across global regions, primarily driven by strong institutional demand in the US. []</title>

      <title>QCP Capital: Ethereum&apos;s performance drives the start of altcoin season, with institutions leading this round of gainsIn its market weekly report released on July 21, QCP Capital stated that multiple altcoin season indicators have exceeded 50, reaching their highest level since December of last year. Coupled with the open interest in ETH perpetual contracts jumping from $18.00B to $28.00B in a week, this marks the potential official start of altcoin season. QCP pointed out that the dominant force in this round of the cycle is institutional investors. Benefiting from the clarity in stablecoin regulatory frameworks brought about by the GENIUS Act, corporate finance departments have begun to increase their holdings of L1 public chain tokens such as ETH, SOL, XRP, and ADA, similar to the role of BTC in the fiscal allocations of Strategy and Metaplanet. If ETH obtains SEC approval for its staking spot ETF in the coming months, it may attract funds to shift from BTC ETFs to ETH, further unlocking yield potential. In fact, the daily net inflow of ETH spot ETFs last week has exceeded that of BTC for two consecutive days, showing a surge in institutional interest in ETH, and BlackRock is also confident in its staking ETH ETF. In addition, bullish call spread trading is active in the ETH options market, with large volumes of call spread positions being established for September and December expirations, highlighting the market&apos;s optimism for the fourth quarter. The current BTC market dominance has fallen from 64% to 60%, while ETH&apos;s market share has risen from 9.7% to 11.6%. If the trend continues, a new round of altcoin season may have begun. QCP stated that it will continue to monitor relevant signals and update developments as soon as possible. [Odaily]</title>

      <title>Crypto investment products see record $4.4 billion in weekly inflows, pushing year-to-date total to $27B: CoinSharesGlobal crypto investment products attracted a record $4.39 billion of inflows last week, their strongest tally since CoinShares began tracking the data in 2014, and more than the previous $4.27 billion peak logged last December after the U.S. general election, the firm&apos;s head of research, James Butterfill, wrote on Monday.

The surge — the 14th consecutive week of net buying — lifted year‑to‑date inflows to $27 billion and pushed assets under management to a new all‑time high of $220 billion. Trading activity in exchange‑traded products also hit a peak, with turnover jumping to $39.2 billion.

Market leader Bitcoin was a primary driver of last week’s flows, but Ethereum was the star and notched a 13th consecutive week of capital allocations, according to Butterfill. Funds linked to the world’s second‑largest cryptocurrency pulled in $2.12 billion, nearly double their prior weekly record of $1.2 billion and taking 2025 inflows to $6.2 billion, already eclipsing last year’s total. Bitcoin products gathered $2.2 billion, down from $2.7 billion the previous week, but still sizable enough to keep overall flows at historic levels.

The United States unsurprisingly dominated geographically with $4.36 billion of inflows to funds offered by firms like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Bitwise, while Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Australia contributed a combined $78.7 million. Brazil and Germany logged modest outflows of $28.1 million and $15.5 million, respectively.

Among other altcoins, Solana, XRP, and Sui products attracted $39 million, $36 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, signaling risk appetite beyond the crypto’s two top heavyweights.</title>
