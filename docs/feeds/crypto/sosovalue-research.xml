      <title>Fed Chair Jerome Powell Accused of Lying Twice, Congressman Requests Criminal ReferralU.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna has submitted a criminal referral to the Department of Justice, accusing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of twice making false statements in testimony and written statements regarding the Fed building renovation project. The move comes as conservatives continue to pressure Trump to replace Powell as soon as possible, but Trump has said it is &quot;highly unlikely&quot; he will remove him from office at this time.

      <title>Tron founder Justin Sun to fly on Blue Origin four years after bidding nearly $30 million for a seatTron founder Justin Sun&apos;s big-money bet is paying for itself with a ride on Jeff Bezos&apos; next space exploration rocket.Blue Origin announced Monday the six-person crew for New Shepard’s 34th mission, which will be the 14th human flight for the New Shepard program and the 34th overall. Since Bezos took off on its inaugural mission in 2021, Blue Origin has flown 70 people above the Kármán line, the internationally recognized boundary of space.Sun placed the winning $28 million bid for the first seat on New Shepard in June 2021. Those proceeds were donated to Blue Origin’s foundation, Club for the Future, which selected 19 space-focused nonprofits to each receive a $1 million grant.&quot;Proud to join Blue Origin’s NS-34 mission and continue encouraging youth to pursue their dreams in science and space!&quot; Sun said Monday in a post on X. The flight date will be announced soon.Tron is one of the leading blockchain-based operating systems, particularly for stablecoins. Before founding Tron, Sun was formerly a chief representative for the Greater China Area at Ripple.As one of the top holders of the Original Trump memecoin, Sun said earlier this month he&apos;s committed to buying $100 million worth of President Donald Trump&apos;s memecoin. He previously invested $75 million into the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial, which in turn bought millions of dollars worth of Tron&apos;s TRX token.Last week, SRM Entertainment announced a rebrand to Tron Inc. after staking 365 million TRX for its crypto treasury and brought on Sun as an adviser.Last November, Sun bought Maurizio Cattelan’s infamous duct-taped banana artwork for $6.24 million.

An institutional investor asked: What progress has the company made in the digital currency business in the first half of this year?

In addition, the company seizes the industry opportunities brought about by the legalization of virtual asset transactions in Hong Kong, and plans to build an eSIM management platform for operators and provide cross-border settlement solutions combining stablecoins and SIM cards for cooperative banks. So far, the company&apos;s digital currency business revenue has increased to a certain extent compared with previous years, but it accounts for a relatively low proportion of the company&apos;s revenue.

      <title>Sources: Polymarket to Spend $112.00M to Acquire Compliant Exchange QCXCryptocurrency prediction platform Polymarket will legally return to the U.S. market after reaching an acquisition agreement with QCX. Previously, Polymarket was required by U.S. federal regulators to operate offshore due to a lack of registration, but recently the U.S. Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have terminated their investigation into it. The acquisition will enable Polymarket to obtain regulatory licenses and officially open to U.S. users. It is reported that Polymarket will acquire derivatives exchange QCX for $112.00 million, which was approved by the CFTC to operate on July 9. (Bloomberg) [Odaily Planet Daily News]</title>

      <title>Analysis: Tariff Deadline Looms, Market Uncertainty Drives Gold Prices Above $3,400.00Gold prices rose more than 1% on Monday, rising above the $3,400.00/ounce level. The dollar and U.S. Treasury yields weakened amid uncertainty over trade negotiations, with the U.S. stipulating that countries must reach an agreement before the August 1 deadline or face more tariffs. &quot;As the August 1 deadline approaches, it&apos;s creating a degree of uncertainty in the market, which is certainly favorable,&quot; said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. Meger said rumors of the U.S. cutting interest rates sooner than expected are heating up, and speculation about a possible replacement of Federal Reserve Chairman Powell and a restructuring of the Fed is adding to market unease.
