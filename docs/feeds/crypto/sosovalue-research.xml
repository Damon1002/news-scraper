      <title>Appeals Court Rules NFTs Qualify for Trademark Protection, Yuga Labs Case Remanded for RetrialOn July 24, The Block reported that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit made an important ruling in the case of Yuga Labs suing artist Ryder Ripps, stating that NFTs are &quot;goods&quot; under the Lanham Act and can be protected as trademarks. The court upheld Yuga Labs&apos; trademark claim against Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, but revoked the previous fine of more than $8.00 million against Ripps, requiring the lower court to re-examine the issue of whether RR/BAYC caused consumer confusion.
The case began in June 2022, when Yuga Labs accused Ripps of devaluing its brand by issuing the RR/BAYC series of NFTs. The court rejected Ripps&apos; defense of &quot;expressive art&quot; and First Amendment protection, but believed that further evidence was needed to prove the possibility of causing consumer confusion.

      <title>JPMorgan: $2 trillion stablecoin market forecast is “overly optimistic”On July 24, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan Chase released a report questioning the $2.00 trillion forecast for the stablecoin market, believing that the figure is &quot;too optimistic.&quot; Analysts pointed out that the current market size of $260.00 billion may only grow by 2-3 times in a few years, far lower than the US Treasury Secretary&apos;s previous expectation of breaking through $2.00 trillion in 2028. The report pointed out that although the GENIUS Act has established a regulatory framework for stablecoins, it will take time to improve the payment infrastructure and ecosystem. Currently, USDT and USDC account for more than 60% of the market share, but stablecoins only account for 1% of global capital flows. Analysts believe that due to investors&apos; conservative attitude towards cash management, it is difficult to use stablecoins as a mainstream liquidity alternative in the short term. JPMorgan Chase emphasized that although stablecoins have the advantage of instant settlement in the field of cross-border payments, merchant acceptance is still higher than that of ordinary consumers.

      <title>IRS Agent Links Tornado Cash’s Roman Storm to Binance Funds and Offshore DealingsFederal prosecutors presented evidence suggesting Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm moved millions through Binance and coordinated with co-founders to send funds and buy offshore real estate. IRS-CI Special Agent Stephan George told the jury he traced over $533,000.00 in USDT from a Binance account allegedly controlled by Storm. He said the funds were moved on August 9, 2022, and distributed across three wallet addresses. Storm Allegedly Sent $2.6 Million Each to Co-Founders Prosecutors showed chat logs between Tornado Cash’s founding trio: Roman Storm, Roman Semenov, and Alexey Pertsev. In one message, Storm wrote: “I overloaded 8 million yesterday.” Another message stated: “I sent you guys 2.6 million each.” Agent George said these communications indicated Storm had access to the funds and decision-making power over the wallet in question. In a separate message, Storm reportedly told a colleague to: “Give her a task to f **ing open various offshores… and to buy real estate.” Prosecutors also read a message from Semenov stating: “I will send some TORN later, to avoid getting busted.” The prosecution argued these messages revealed intent to obscure transactions and profit from Tornado Cash’s operations. 96% of Tornado Cash Users Relied on Web Interface Earlier in the day, prosecution expert Philip Werlau of AnChain.AI testified that 96.2% of users accessed Tornado Cash through its user interface (UI), not the command line. He said Lazarus Group shifted to CLI usage only after US sanctions were imposed. Werlau said this behavior suggested a deliberate attempt to avoid detection. During cross-examination, Roman Storm’s defense challenged Werlau’s conclusions. He emphasized that Tornado Cash’s smart contract pools became immutable in May 2020, meaning neither Storm nor the DAO could change them. Klein also clarified that Tornado’s UI did not handle transactions directly. Deposits and withdrawals required interacting with Ethereum’s smart contracts, not any centralized interface. Meanwhile, prosecutors presented an email from an earlier witness, Ms. Lin, addressed to Tornado Cash’s public inbox. Judge Failla warned the jury not to treat its content as fact. The email’s inclusion may relate to the defense’s previously stated mistrial concerns, though no motion was filed. What’s Next in the Tornado Cash Trial The prosecution is expected to rest its case tomorrow morning. A separate hearing on the Chainalysis expert testimony is still pending. Storm’s defense is preparing to present its side, focusing on the immutability of Tornado Cash and Storm’s lack of control after deployment. [Wu Shuo]</title>

      <title>White House: Trump does not support Musk&apos;s artificial intelligence company receiving federal contractsWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that she believes U.S. President Donald Trump does not support federal agencies contracting with Elon Musk&apos;s artificial intelligence company. When asked if Trump wants to cancel recent contracts with Musk&apos;s AI ventures, Jean-Pierre said she would discuss the matter with the president. About a week ago, Musk&apos;s xAI, along with three other major tech companies, was awarded a Department of Defense contract worth up to $200.00M. Trump and Musk have been in a heated feud since Musk resigned as a government special employee at the end of May. Trump said he could retaliate against Musk by canceling federal contracts with Musk&apos;s businesses. (The Hill) [Odaily]</title>

      <title>US Florida judge rejects request to unseal Epstein case grand jury recordsOn Wednesday, a federal judge in Florida rejected a request from the Department of Justice to release grand jury records from the Epstein investigation. Attorney General Bondi pushed for the release of the Epstein case&apos;s grand jury materials in an effort to quell the anger of Trump&apos;s MAGA base, who have urged the government to disclose Epstein&apos;s alleged &quot;client list.&quot; Earlier this month, Trump&apos;s Justice Department and the FBI said that no such client list exists, and Bondi said she would not release any further materials. Despite the rejection in Florida, the Justice Department has another opportunity, as they have also asked two federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts, where prosecutors filed lawsuits against Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Federal courts in New York generally take a less strict approach to grand jury secrecy. (Politico) [Odaily]</title>
