      <title>NFTs qualify for trademark protection, Ninth Circuit rules, sending Yuga Labs case back for trialThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a significant ruling on Wednesday in the longstanding case between Yuga Labs, creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, and Ryder Ripps, a conceptual artist who sold a collection of identical images as &quot;expressive appropriation art.&quot;

Yuga originally sued Ripps in June 2022, accusing him of devaluing the original collection by selling NFTs through his project, Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club (often stylized as RR/BAYC), which featured identical images as the original BAYC collection. The complex legal battle has progressed over three years to the Ninth Circuit, after Ripps appealed a prior ruling that he owed Yuga Labs nearly $9 million in penalties and other costs.

The court, in its ruling issued Wednesday, found that NFTs are &quot;goods&quot; under the Lanham Act, which governs trademarks and unfair competition, deciding that Yuga Labs is entitled to trademark protections for its Bored Ape NFTs. This ruling could have significant implications for NFT law moving forward, setting a precedent that brand owners can sue NFT lookalikes as easily as counterfeit sneakers or handbags.

However, despite the ruling also throwing out many of Ripps&apos; legal arguments, the court did not give Yuga Labs summary judgment in the case, instead sending the case back to a lower court for a trial to determine whether a typical NFT buyer would be confused about the legitimacy of Ripps&apos; collection. The $9 million penalty and an injunction that blocked RR/BAYC sales were both vacated by the ruling.

&quot;The panel could not conclude as a matter of law that a reasonably prudent consumer in the marketplace was likely to be confused as to the origin of the goods bearing Yuga’s marks,&quot; the three-judge panel wrote in its decision.

The panel said Yuga would need to prove its claim that the RR/BAYC caused consumer confusion to a fact-finder at trial; this may be a jury or another judge, depending on what the parties request and how the district court structures the remand.

Ripps, a conceptual artist and designer who has worked with the likes of Kanye West, framed the mixed result as a &quot;resounding legal victory&quot; in a statement. &quot;Ryder Ripps’s RR/BAYC series is expressive appropriation art — a deliberate repurposing of Bored Ape Yacht Club imagery to critique Yuga Labs’s branding strategies and the speculative frenzy around NFTs,&quot; Ripps wrote. &quot;The Ninth Circuit’s ruling affirms that such pointed commentary falls squarely within First Amendment protections and cannot be curtailed at the summary‐judgment phase.&quot;

Yet the Court&apos;s ruling states outright that Ripps&apos; use of the BAYC trademarks &quot;did not constitute nominative fair use and was not &apos;expressive work&apos; protected by the First Amendment.&quot;

Ripps told The Block that he may appeal the court&apos;s rejection of some of the legal arguments he and his lawyers presented thus far. He also said prior settlement talks with Yuga Labs had gone nowhere, calling some of Yuga&apos;s demands &quot;absurd.&quot;

&quot;Yuga basically wanted to microchip my entire family, it was that absurd,&quot; Ripps alleged. &quot;They are spending tens of millions of dollars to harass me because I effectively made fun of their stupid racist monkey cartoon scam.&quot;

&quot;The fact there are million of derivatives of BAYC and they only have gone after me should say enough,&quot; Ripps added. &quot;This isn&apos;t a real business protecting IP.&quot;

Yuga Labs was unable to be immediately reached for comment by The Block following the ruling. [The Block]</title>

      <title>Bitwise is &apos;actively evaluating&apos; the SEC&apos;s pause on its initially approved crypto index fundBitwise says it&apos;s &quot;actively evaluating&quot; the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&apos;s recent move to pause the conversion of its cryptocurrency index fund after initially approving it to list and trade.

In a statement, a Bitwise spokesperson said the crypto index fund manager was &quot;thrilled by the SEC&apos;s accelerated approval,&quot; and noted they&apos;re assessing the pause.

&quot;The subsequent stay is a new development that we’re actively evaluating,&quot; the spokesperson said in an email on Wednesday. &quot;We’ve been encouraged by the constructive engagement with the SEC under the new administration and remain committed to working productively to expand access to crypto — just as we’ve done over the last seven years.”

On Tuesday, the SEC&apos;s Division of Trading and Markets granted an &quot;accelerated approval&quot; of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF, according to a filing. However, SEC Assistant Secretary Sherry R. Haywood later stayed the action and said the commission would review it.

The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which trades under the ticker “BITW,” currently consists of exposure to BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, Polkadot, among others, on a market cap-weighted basis, according to its website.

This marks the second instance the SEC has hit pause on an initial approval to convert a fund to an ETF. A similar scenario occurred with Grayscale&apos;s proposed conversion of its Digital Large Cap Fund, which was initially approved and later put under review. Grayscale has said it &quot;remains committed&quot; to continue trying to list the fund.

This comes amid a broader shift as the SEC is also considering a wide array of crypto ETFs, from ones that track SOL to DOGE in the face of a friendlier regulatory environment for crypto following President Donald Trump&apos;s inauguration in January. [Bitwise]</title>

      <title>Standard Chartered-backed Zodia Custody joins Ondo’s Global Markets AllianceZodia Custody, a digital assets custody platform backed by Standard Chartered, has joined the Global Markets Alliance, an initiative by Ondo Finance aimed at promoting interoperability across the tokenized assets market. As the Global Markets Alliance’s newest member, Zodia Custody adds to a group of industry players that include Solana Foundation, LayerZero, BitGo, Fireblocks, Jupiter, Trust Wallet, 1inch, Alpaca, and Bitget. Ondo Finance announced the Zodia Custody move via X. Like the other members, Zodia Custody will leverage its infrastructure, security and compliance features to help advance the tokenization of capital markets. The on-chain efforts aligns with the institution-first digital assets custodian’s traction across the ecosystem, efforts that include the support for institutional decentralized finance on the TON blockchain, Berachain and RWA platform Polymesh. The Global Markets Alliance’s areas of focus across the real-world assets on-chain ecosystem includes tokenized stocks, exchange-traded funds, money market funds and private credit. RWA on-chain is a rapidly expanding market, with major players, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity Investments, driving adoption to the next level. The key to growing tokenization lies in its feature that enables the bridging of traditional finance and blockchain, with real-world assets wrapped into tokens issued on the blockchain. Investors taking positions with these assets benefit from 24/7 trading, fractional ownership and on-chain transparency and accessibility. With institutional clients eyeing the tokenization opportunity, major Wall Street banks have had no option but to consider launching their own tokenized assets initiatives. Zodia, which also offers a staking solution, counts asset managers, banks, crypto natives, governments, hedge funds, and private wealth firms among its partners.  The platform recently launched Zodia Rewards, its opt-in token rewards program targeted for institutional clients. Clients can enjoy rewards on supported stablecoins, including USDC ( USDC ), Ethena USDe ( USDE ) and the Global Dollar Network. “Stablecoins are being adopted far beyond crypto capital markets, emerging as a tool to complement traditional financial rails for cross-border payments. We see this value, and as a custodian, we want to play our part to help unlock further capital efficiencies,” Anoosh Arevshatian, chief product officer at Zodia Custody, said at the time.

      <title>Brazil’s VERT launches private credit solution on the XRP LedgerVERT, a Brazil-based capital markets firm, has joined the growing trend of companies looking to tap into tokenization with a new solution on XRP Ledger. The fund management firm’s move comes as Wall Street giants such as Goldman Sachs, BNY and JPMorgan a tokenized assets market that has attracted products from fund behemoths like BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton. XRP Ledger is powered by the XRP ( XRP ) token. VERT’s blockchain-based platform on the XRPL will focus on the issuance and management of private credit operations. Ripple expands its reach in LATAM with this initiative. According to the details, the on-chain venture goes live with the issuance of an Agribusiness Receivables Certificate. The RCA is a regulated credit instrument managed across a sector that accounts for over 20% of Brazil ’s gross domestic product. “Agribusiness plays an essential role in Brazil’s economy, and improving how credit is structured and tracked in this sector is a meaningful advancement,” said Silvio Pegado, managing director of Ripple in Latin America. The first CRA transaction will be valued at 700 million Brazilian real, or approximately $130 million. Recently, Token Relations revealed the total tokenized real-world assets on XRPL had grown by more than 2,260% in six months — from $5 million at the start of the year to over $118 million at the beginning of July. Mercado Bitcoin, Latin America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange and alternative asset investment platform, announced on July 4 that it will bring over $200 million in tokenized RWAs to the XRPL. The assets the platform plans to tokenize on the blockchain include fixed income and equity instruments. Guggenheim Capital is also tapping into the XRP Ledger. Its subsidiary, Guggenheim Treasury Services, issued U.S. Treasury-backed digital commercial paper on the Ripple blockchain platform. June also saw tokenized assets platform Ondo Finance unveil its short-term Treasuries bill OUSG , while Circle added native USDC ( USDC ) to XRP Ledger. VERT’s initiative will add to this traction as it helps Brazil’s capital markets come on-chain. The company aims to generate $500 million in value that will be on-chain. Benefits will include increased operational efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. As well as issuing private credit on the XRPL, VERT is integrating Ripple’s Ethereum-compatible protocol XRPL EVM Sidechain to leverage smart contracts for programmable automation among other functionality.
