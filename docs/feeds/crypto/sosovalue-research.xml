      <title>CryptoQuant analyst: Ethereum may experience a pullback in the short term, but the magnitude and duration are not expected to be too largeOn July 23, CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan said that Ethereum has recently risen sharply and may experience a correction in the short term, but the magnitude and duration are not expected to be too large. He pointed out that compared with the overheated market in March and November 2024, the current market is not high. Although Ethereum has performed slowly in this cycle, it has bottomed out and may continue to rise in the second half of 2025. He also mentioned that the rise of Ethereum often drives the performance of other currencies, and investors can pay attention to the subsequent market trends. [PANews]</title>

      <title>Walrus Announces Collaboration with Gata to Help Build Open AI Execution InfrastructureOn July 23, Walrus Protocol, a blockchain storage protocol built on Sui, announced a partnership with Gata, which is dedicated to developing decentralized large model inference, training, and data technology, to become a core component of Gata AI&apos;s open execution infrastructure. With Walrus, Gata will solve the high data access costs that have long plagued decentralized AI. This integration directly empowers Gata&apos;s DataAgent, allowing anyone to contribute idle computing power with one click through a browser, collaboratively generating synthetic datasets needed for AI training. Walrus provides performance comparable to centralized cloud services and low-cost storage, and more importantly, eliminates download fees, allowing the Gata community to conduct large-scale data interaction in a permissionless manner without incurring unpredictable and unsustainable costs. In the future, Gata plans to leverage Walrus&apos;s unique on-chain data programmability to build an open, auditable pricing model. By storing verifiable computation proofs on Walrus, Gata can use Move-based smart contracts to transparently verify computation tasks and settle on-chain, creating a fairer pricing mechanism for service providers, which is a major improvement over the opaque models used by current centralized AI providers. It is reported that Walrus is a new generation storage protocol built for AI Agents, on-chain applications, and enterprises that process large-scale unstructured data. Whether it&apos;s images, videos, audio files, or dynamic metadata, Walrus can store them efficiently, securely, and economically through its distributed node network. [深潮 TechFlow]</title>

      <title>Matrixport: Crypto market faces short-term volatility, but overall uptrend is not overMatrixport released a chart today stating that Bitcoin&apos;s open interest has increased significantly by $6.00B in the past two weeks, and the annualized funding rate has soared to 19.00%, indicating a large number of aggressive leveraged long positions in the market. At the same time, the activity of South Korean retail investors has increased significantly, and cryptocurrency trading volume has jumped from $1.00B to $6.00B, reflecting the dominant role of retail funds in this round of market conditions. However, as prices enter a sideways phase, these highly leveraged long positions may face the risk of passive liquidation, especially after next week&apos;s FOMC meeting, when the market will enter a relatively quiet August trading period. Despite short-term volatility pressure, multiple key positives are building momentum for after the summer, and the overall upward trend in the crypto market is not over. [Odaily]</title>

      <title>Kled AI founder and Believe founder accuse each other, escalating the conflictBelieve ecosystem project Kled AI founder Avi Patel has expressed disappointment with the current handling of the Believe ecosystem, claiming a complete lack of support and communication. Believe founder Ben Pasternak accuses Avi of being a founder lacking integrity, alleging that Avi secretly sold $500,000.00 worth of KLED and lied that the sale was at Ben&apos;s direction. However, it is worth noting that yesterday, the official Believe Twitter account praised Kled for becoming a major data platform on Solana in just three months. [Wu Blockchain]</title>

      <title>Institutions: The US economy has not declined as expected, and AI may be the main contributorAccording to foreign media analysis reports, for the second time in three years, concerns about a US economic recession have once again been refuted by reality. This time, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may be the main contributor. As generative AI enters its third year, its financial impact is no longer limited to the stock prices of chip manufacturers. The surge in data center construction and overall capital expenditure is &quot;beautifying&quot; US GDP data in a surprising way. Carlyle Group&apos;s chief investment strategist Jason Thomas pointed out that this capital expenditure is an effective reindustrialization of American companies, shifting their focus from software and intangible assets to factories, machinery, and energy investments, which is unprecedented. This has a huge impact on GDP. Thomas estimates that AI-related spending alone may have contributed one-third of the US GDP growth in the second quarter of this year. And orders in related industries are still expanding at an annual growth rate of more than 40%. [Odaily News]</title>

      <title>Pi Coin Teases a Quick 40% Burst If This One EMA Cross ConfirmsPi Coin is steady around $0.47 after the “Buy Pi” fiat on‑ramp announcement kicked price up to $0.52; the first real push in days. Two technical signals on the lower timeframe hint this may not be a one-off bounce: trend strength is back, and a second moving‑average trigger is close. Trend Strength Returns, But Needs Confirmation The Average Directional Index (ADX) on the 4‑hour chart is back above 30. That tells us the price move has strength behind it, not just random sentiment. However, the current ADX peak is lower than the last one. In plain terms, the Pi Coin price trend is there, but it is not yet stronger than the previous swing. A new ADX high, or simply keeping ADX above the mid‑20s, would firm up confidence. The 4‑hour view is prioritized here because Tuesday’s jump happened inside the day; signals show up there first before the daily chart reacts. ADX measures how strong a trend is (0 to 100). It does not say up or down, so it must be read with price action. Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter  here . One EMA Trigger Still Pending The fast (20-period) Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has already crossed above the medium (50-period) EMA, and that lined up with the move from $0.45 to $0.52. The same thing happened in late June when the price ran from about $0.56 to $0.66. Back then, the fast EMA failed to clear the next slower (100-period) EMA, and the Pi Coin rally faded. That second cross is now getting close again, almost waiting to happen. If it happens this time while ADX stays firm, the odds of a bigger PI price rally improve. The 200‑period EMA (blue line) on the 4‑hour chart was briefly crossed by the price yesterday, before experiencing resistance. A clean close above it would match the price structure with momentum. EMAs weigh recent prices more than older ones, so when the shorter lines climb over the longer ones, it signals rising speed in the move. Key Pi Coin Price Levels to Watch The daily chart sets the main levels for the bigger picture. A trend‑based Fibonacci extension is used here. It links three points: the late‑June low at $0.47, the swing high near $0.66, and the mid‑July pullback to $0.42. Tuesday’s candle pushed through three Fibonacci bands in one day: 0.236 at $0.46, 0.382 at $0.49, and 0.5 at $0.51. PI Price is now pausing in the $0.46–$0.49 range. A daily close above that range opens $0.54 first (0.618) and then $0.66, the prior swing high, roughly 40% above current levels if momentum carries on and the much-awaited EMA cross finally happens. An inverted bullish hammer formed on the rebound (Tuesday candle), showing buyers stepped in near the lows. Invalidation is clear: a close back under $0.46, ADX dropping under the mid‑20s, and the 20-period EMA failing to clear the 100-period line would likely send Pi Coin’s price back toward $0.42.</title>
