      <title>250,000 Tether Gold tokens in circulation are backed by 7.66 tons of gold, Tether saysTether says it now has nearly 250,000 Tether Gold (XAU₮) tokens in circulation, as of Q2 2025. Each token is backed 1:1 by a troy ounce of physical gold, the equivalent of more than 7.66 tons of gold in total, the company said in an announcement on Thursday.

“Gold-backed digital assets, such as XAU₮, are increasingly viewed as essential portfolio hedges,” Tether said in a statement, pointing to shifting macroeconomic uncertainties, fiat volatility, and rising debt.

“Tether Gold offers a familiar asset in a future-forward format,” the company added. “As the world rethinks the nature of money, XAU₮ stands ready to serve both as a safe haven and a functional, transferable reserve asset for users across the globe.”

Launched in January 2020, Tether Gold is a stablecoin meant to represent one troy ounce of physical gold, specifically London Good Delivery gold bars. It has a total market capitalization above $830 million, according to Tether’s website.

The XAU₮ token, available on platforms like Kraken, KuCoin, and Bitfinex, is meant to give investors an alternative form of exposure to gold. Holders can reportedly redeem their holdings for physical gold that’s held in Swiss vaults.

Tether’s flagship USD-pegged stablecoin, USDT, is the world&apos;s largest with a total market capitalization of $162 billion, according to The Block&apos;s price page. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has signaled that the company is looking to enter U.S. markets following President Donald Trump’s signing of the GENIUS Act into law.

Ardoino has also said that obtaining a full review from a Big Four audit firm — Deloitte, EY, PwC, or KPMG — is a &quot;top priority.&quot;</title>

      <title>REX-Osprey&apos;s Solana staking ETF to pass on 100% of rewards to shareholders as it integrates JitoSOLREX-Osprey’s Solana staking exchange-traded fund has integrated staking rewards through a partnership with JitoSOL, the leading liquid staking token on Solana. This makes it the first and only crypto ETF to offer staking rewards to U.S. investors, according to an announcement on Thursday.

According to the announcement, 100% of the fund’s staking rewards will be “passed through to shareholders, with neither REX nor Osprey retaining any portion.”

The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF went live on July 2 as the first approved fund to stake its assets. The fund has accrued at least $222 million in cumulative trading volume and over $100 million in net assets under management since its debut, according to The Block Research.

“Now by integrating the capability for liquid staking through JitoSOL, we’re enhancing liquidity while continuing to deliver native Solana rewards within a U.S. ETF structure,” Greg King, CEO of REX Financial &amp; Osprey Funds, said in a statement.

JitoSOL, a liquid staking token, is a tokenized version of staked SOL that enables users to continue trading the value of their staked assets while still earning on-chain rewards. There is approximately $3 billion worth of JitoSOL in circulation, according to The Block’s data.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has clarified that it does not believe most staking activities fall under its remit. However, the agency has been hesitant to approve staking ETFs. REX-Osprey’s fund was approved under a more stringent regulatory model called the Investment Company Act of 1940, which requires a qualified custodian to hold the assets.

REX-Osprey tapped Anchorage Digital as its custodian and staking partner. Staking represents an increasingly fast-growing part of crypto custodians like Anchorage and BitGo’s business model.

“JitoSOL becoming the first liquid staking token included in a U.S. ETF is a landmark moment — not just for Jito, but for the future of staked assets in traditional financial products,&quot; Thomas Uhm, Jito Foundation chief commercial officer, said in a statement. [The Block Research]</title>

      <title>Confessions of a Laptop Farmer: How an American Helped North Korea’s Wild Remote Worker SchemeWhen Christina Marie Chapman first stumbled blindly into a web of international intrigue, in 2020, she’d been trying to turn her life around. She was living in the tiny town of Brook Park, Minnesota, occupying a run-down travel trailer on a rural property her mother owned. Over Chapman’s adult life she’d lived in Texas, England and Colorado—drifting between jobs at big-box stores, fast-food chains, casinos, mortgage brokers—“not anything that I ever dreamed of doing as a child,” she recalls.The daughter of an ex-Marine father and an accountant mother, she’d been born in South Korea, where her father was stationed, and bounced around before spending her formative years in Pine City, a dozen miles from Brook Park. Now, at 44, she’d retreated home to start over. She took out loans to attend a coding boot camp, hoping to pull herself out of the mire of dead-end jobs. Finally done with the coursework after five months and thousands of dollars, she created a LinkedIn profile to advertise her new skills. Occupation: software engineer.</title>

      <title>Strategy upsizes preferred &apos;Stretch&apos; stock offering to $2.00 billion to buy more bitcoinBitcoin treasury firm Strategy plans to quadruple the size of its recently announced Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock offer to $2.00 billion from $500.00 million after strong demand for bitcoin‑focused shares, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Moelis, and TD Securities are bookrunners on the latest Stretch sale.

Proceeds from Strategy’s expanded facility are earmarked to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. Last week, the company spent $739.90 million generated from share sales on 6,220 BTC, increasing its holdings to 607,770, The Block’s data shows. That’s currently valued at over $72.00 billion and roughly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million.

The company, formerly known as MicroStrategy, will offer Stretch shares at a price of $90 per share, a 10% discount to face value and the low end of a marketed range of $100. The securities carry an initial 9% annual dividend that Strategy can reset monthly.

Stretch, the company’s fourth preferred stock program, reportedly ranks senior to the firm’s Strike (STRK) and Stride (STRD) preferred stock and its common shares, but subordinate to its Strife (STRF) preferred series and outstanding convertible notes.

Earlier this week, TD Cowen said the company’s preferred‑stock arsenal could help Strategy lift its holdings to nearly 900,000 BTC by 2027, arguing each share controls more Bitcoin today than 18 months ago despite aggressive issuance. Strategy’s net asset value premium, the percentage by which its market cap surpasses its BTC holdings, is justified since the company can effectively borrow at low rates and stockpile crypto’s largest asset, the brokerage stated.

Strategy’s common stock is trading around $414, giving the firm a market capitalization of $124.00 billion, according to The Block’s data dashboard. [Bloomberg]</title>

      <title>Resolv Enables Protocol Fee Mechanism, Returns Will Reward Stakers and Drive Ecosystem ExpansionResolv has announced the official launch of a protocol fee mechanism starting in July 2025, where a portion of the daily revenue will be used for long-term value accumulation and distributed to RESOLV stakers. The protocol fee will gradually increase to 10% of daily profits over 4 weeks and will only be charged when there is a positive return, without affecting the principal or days with zero returns. Protocol revenue will be used to expand DeFi and institutional integration, fund ecosystem development, promote token buybacks, and usage will be made public through a transparent dashboard.

      <title>Centralized exchange WOO X investigates &apos;contained incident&apos; resulting in estimated $14 million lossWOO X, a little-known centralized crypto trading platform, said it is investigating “a contained incident” impacting nine customer accounts on Thursday. The company noted that “unauthorized withdrawals were placed,” totalling an estimated $14 million.

“The incident was quickly detected and as a precaution, withdrawals were paused and many of the withdrawals were blocked,” WOO X said. “We&apos;ve already contacted the affected users, and all unauthorized withdrawals will be covered.”

The firm said it is working with external security teams and other exchanges to halt the flow of funds. WOO X trading volumes have spiked 264.8% over the past 24-hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Crypto security firm Cyvers has begun tracking funds as they move along the Arbitrum, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Tron networks. The firm said about $1 million worth of USDT was swapped into ETH with an additional $7.3 million worth of funds later sent to a new address.

An additional five wrapped BTC tokens on the BNB Chain were swapped into BNB tokens and sent to a new address, Cyvers said.

Crypto hacks are not an uncommon occurrence in the industry. Chainalysis estimates there were losses totaling at least $2.2 billion in 2024 across centralized and decentralized blockchain platforms. This represents a 21.07% year-over-year increase during a year that saw rising crypto prices, which is typically a driving factor in increasing crypto crime.

WOO X is a Seychelles-registered centralized exchange established in 2019. The firm most recently raised $9 million in a 2024 funding round with participation from Wintermute, Selini Capital, among others.

Notably, in 2023, WOO X temporarily paused trading activity after its largest market maker and incubator, Kronos Research, experienced a $25 million hack, in a move that caused it to revamp its market mechanisms. [WOO X]</title>

      <title>Ethereum holding company GameSquare purchases CryptoPunk NFT as treasury asset for $5.15 million in preferred sharesIn something of a novel move for the increasingly saturated crypto treasury space, Ethereum holding company GameSquare (ticker GAME) has acquired a CryptoPunk NFT. The firm says it will now hold the “iconic” piece as a “strategic treasury asset.”

GameSquare purchased the token — Punk #5577, one of just 24 “Ape Punks” — for $5.15 million in an equity trade with its previous owner, DeFi OG Robert Leshner. The preferred stock will be convertible into common shares at $1.50 per share.

Leshner, the founder of Superstate and Compound, appears to have purchased CryptoPunk #5577 in February 2022 for 2,501 ETH, equivalent to approximately $7.7 million at the time. The asset is distinguished by its cowboy hat.

The 10,000 token CryptoPunks series was one of the earliest experiments with non-fungible tokens when launched in 2017. Yuga Labs, which bought the CryptoPunks IP from creator Larva Labs in March 2022, sold the project to the nonprofit Infinite Node Foundation in May of this year.

“This isn’t just our first grail NFT, it’s a signal of how we’re thinking differently and expanding our existing footprint in digital culture by building a next-generation media company with crypto in its DNA,” Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare, said in a statement.

GameSquare is one of many newly emerging Ethereum treasury firms. Early this month, the firm’s board approved a $100 million ETH treasury authorization, which was later expanded to $250 million. The firm has acquired approximately 10,170.74 ETH, now worth $52 million, as of July 21.

Unlike other ETH balance sheet plays that typically stake their holdings for yield, GameSquare said it will pursue higher returns through DeFi deployments, namely Dialectic’s institutional Medici platform. The board also approved an initial $10 million allocation to an NFT yield strategy, targeting 6%–10% annualized returns.

According to the announcement on Thursday, Leshner has joined the firm as an advisor and will help it tokenize its GAME shares on the Superstate platform.

Recently, Leshner’s attempt at a hostile takeover of a “low market cap” liquor firm to start a crypto treasury was thwarted after its executives diluted his ownership.
