If passed, the VA will submit a feasibility study and pilot recommendation report within one year. [CryptoSlate]</title>

      <title>Could Pi Coin Be Listed on Binance? New Developments in Pi Wallet Spark SpeculationSpeculation is growing that Pi Network’s Pi Coin (PI) could potentially be listed on Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange. This comes following reports from several Pioneers who noticed Binance support options appearing in the Pi Wallet. However, neither Binance nor the Pi Core Team has confirmed or commented on the development, leaving the rumor mill to run wild. Pi Coin on Binance? Rumors Grow Stronger Amid New Wallet Features The listing of Pi Coin on Binance has been a longstanding concern for the Pi Network community, known as Pioneers. Since the launch of the open network, Pioneers have consistently advocated for Pi to be listed on the exchange. However, this has not yet materialized. Recently, the integration of Binance-related support options within the Pi Wallet has renewed the community’s optimism. This has raised hopes that a partnership between Pi Network and Binance may soon be realized. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), a prominent Pioneer, Mr Spock, highlighted that ‘Binance Connect Support’ and ‘Binance P2P Support ‘ options now appear under the Help &amp; Support tab of the Pi Wallet. For context, Binance Connect is the exchange’s fiat-to-crypto service. It facilitates the easy purchase and conversion of fiat currencies into cryptocurrencies through various payment methods. The exchange shut the service down in 2023. Nevertheless, Binance later relaunched in 2024. Meanwhile, Binance P2P enables direct peer-to-peer transactions with more than 800 payment methods and over 100 fiat currencies. However, Mr Spock added that the development doesn’t directly confirm that Pi Network will be available to trade on Binance immediately. Nonetheless, he noted that it strongly suggests that ‘something big is coming.’ Furthermore, PiScan data revealed that a mysterious wallet address has accumulated over 336 million Pi. This has fueled theories that it might belong to an exchange preparing for listing. Despite the circulating reports on X, it is also worth noting that Binance is not a part of KYB-verified businesses on Pi Network. Moreover, besides the exchange, Pi Wallet also lists support for other payment processors like MoonPay and Stripe. These businesses are also not KYB-verified. The Pi Core Team has remained silent on the matter, leaving the community to grapple with unverified reports. Premature speculation has historically led to community disappointment. Until an official announcement from Pi Network or Binance materializes, the current developments remain rumors.</title>
