      <title>Hong Kong Customs busts a money laundering case suspected of using stablecoins, involving approximately HKD 1.15B.Hong Kong Customs today cracked a money laundering case suspected of using smuggled cash and virtual assets, involving approximately 1.15B yuan, and arrested a local man and a non-local man. It is reported that Hong Kong Customs officers identified a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man and launched a wealth investigation. They found that the two smuggled cash out of the country and frequently and rapidly conducted huge amounts of stablecoin and fiat currency transactions with funds of unknown origin, which was extremely inconsistent with their background and financial situation, and were suspected of engaging in money laundering activities. During the operation, customs officers seized a batch of suspected items, including mobile phones, tablets and bank cards. The case is still under investigation, and the two arrested persons are currently released on bail pending investigation, and it is not ruled out that more people will be arrested.
