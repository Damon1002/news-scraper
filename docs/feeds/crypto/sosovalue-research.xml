      <title>GitHub calls for European sovereign tech fund to support open source softwareOn July 23, according to the GitHub blog, open source software as digital infrastructure is vital to the economy and society, but its maintenance funds have long been insufficient. The GitHub Developer Policy Team commissioned Open Forum Europe, Fraunhofer ISI, and the European University Institute to conduct a feasibility study to explore the extension of the successful experience of Germany&apos;s sovereign technology institutions to the EU level and promote the establishment of the &quot;EU Sovereign Technology Fund&quot; (EU-STF). The study recommends that the fund should focus on investing in open source dependency, maintenance, security, improvement, and ecosystem construction, and proposes seven design standards, including funding pools, low bureaucracy, political independence, flexible funding, community participation, strategic alignment, and high transparency. GitHub calls on the EU to invest at least 350.00 million euros in the 2028-2035 budget, and to jointly fund with industry and countries to ensure the sustainable development and digital sovereignty of open source software.

      <title>Trusta.AI responds to third-party contract fraud incident, official $TA tokens are safeOn July 23, Trusta.AI reported that an external fraud incident involving an unverified third-party contract (0x16d7c6f43df19778e382b7a84bcb8c763971a551) recently occurred on the blockchain. Trusta and the official $TA tokens remain safe and intact, and no vulnerabilities or problems have been found. The attack was caused by the failure of the non-open source contract to verify user input, which allowed the attacker to use the WBNB tokens of authorized users to exchange through the self-built WBNB-TA pool and sell their own $TA tokens to illegally obtain WBNB. Trusta.AI recommends that users immediately revoke their authorization to the contract and promises to repurchase $TA worth $200,000.00 to protect user interests. [PANews]</title>

This round of financing was led by ByteTrade/SIG Capital (Susquehanna) and Mirana/Mantle Eco Fund, and participated by EVM Capital, Taisu Ventures, NGC Ventures and other institutions. Gaia Labs currently supports more than 700,000 active nodes, with a cumulative inference time of more than 17.00 trillion times, and the network covers thousands of App-Chain domains and blockchain ecosystems.

      <title>BNY, Goldman Sachs ink tokenized money market fund deal to bring $7.1 trillion industry onchainBank of New York Mellon and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday launched a blockchain-based system that issues “mirror” tokens of money market fund shares, letting institutional investors subscribe and redeem through BNY’s LiquidityDirect platform while ownership is recorded on Goldman’s GS DAP ledger, marking the first U.S. rollout of tokenized MMF shares by major lenders.

Under the initiative, BNY will keep the official books and settlement records for participating funds, which reportedly already includes products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Federated Hermes, BNY’s Dreyfus unit, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. BNY will also create digital token representations simultaneously, designed to boost collateral mobility and transferability.

The project targets a $7.1 trillion money market industry and arrives a week after President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, establishing the first federal framework for U.S. stablecoins. Policymakers are also working on a crypto market structure bill that they say should broaden access to regulated digital asset services.

Unlike traditional money markets that trade during limited market hours, tokenized funds enjoy round-the-clock availability and expansive liquidity features because they sit on a blockchain network.

Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs&apos; global head of digital assets, said tokenizing MMF shares could unlock their use as collateral and pave the way for faster, more seamless moves across markets. The Goldman exec sees it as part of a longer-term push to modernize market plumbing, while BNY framed the project as a step toward a real-time financial architecture. &quot;Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,&quot; Laide Majiyagbe, global head of liquidity, financing, and collateral at BNY, said.

It’s the first time major banks have ventured into blockchain-based money markets, but the tokenization trend has already attracted notable traditional finance players. Onchain products like BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI collectively command over $3 billion in assets, while the total real-world asset value in DeFi has exceeded $10.7 billion according to The Block’s data dashboard.

Announced on July 21, 2025, the service targets new construction properties and is facilitated through a strategic partnership with New Estate Only (NEO), a platform specializing in new real estate developments. Additionally, ByteFederal’s collaboration with OPISAS, an international real estate firm, allows foreign investors to purchase U.S. properties with cryptocurrency, expanding access to Florida’s housing market. The Florida pilot enables buyers to pay security deposits and final closing payments in Bitcoin, which ByteFederal converts to USD for escrow or title companies. “We generate a Bitcoin QR code, you make the Bitcoin payment, we handle the conversion, and then we deliver USD fiat to the escrow or title company for closing,” said Paul Tarantino, CEO of ByteFederal, in an interview. The service, currently manual, has a growing waitlist and is set to become fully automated soon. Buyers can fund transactions entirely in Bitcoin or combine crypto with fiat, offering flexibility for diverse financial strategies. ByteFederal’s partnership with NEO leverages the latter’s platform, which serves as a multiple listing service (MLS) for new construction, a market segment traditionally absent from traditional MLS platforms. NEO, venture capital-backed and operational in Florida and Texas, lists properties like single-family homes, townhomes, condos and high-rise apartments. “NEO is the first company to build a big platform for all the new housing and development projects,” Tarantino explained.  The collaboration with OPISAS targets international investors, particularly from Italy, seeking U.S. real estate. OPISAS facilitates property selection, while ByteFederal handles crypto-to-fiat conversions, ensuring sellers receive USD without exposure to Bitcoin’s price volatility. This partnership aligns with growing global interest in U.S. real estate, with NEO planning expansions to Colombia, El Salvador, Italy and Dubai. “They can be going in both directions — someone in the U.S. buying real estate in Colombia or someone in Colombia buying in the U.S.,” Tarantino noted, highlighting the platform’s global potential. ByteFederal, based in Florida, operates Bitcoin ATMs, offers the ByteWallet and provides ByteConnect, a point-of-sale system for merchants. With 15 money transmitter licenses, the company emphasizes regulatory compliance, positioning itself to benefit from recent U.S. regulatory developments like the Clarity Act, which may provide legal clarity for stablecoins like Tether and Lightning Network transactions. “It’s going to bring a lot of new users into the market who were maybe afraid of it or didn’t feel comfortable stepping in yet,” Tarantino said, referencing the custodial wallet launch planned for September 2025. This initiative comes amid broader shifts in U.S. financial policy. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is exploring crypto assets for mortgage underwriting, a move that could integrate digital currencies into mainstream finance. ByteFederal’s service addresses key challenges, such as taxation and liquidity, by providing a compliant bridge between crypto and fiat. The company’s focus on new construction and international buyers positions it to capitalize on Florida’s robust real estate market and growing crypto adoption.</title>

      <title>Max Keiser Says MicroStrategy Is ‘Tearing Up the Rulebook’ to Reach 1M Bitcoin | US Crypto NewsWelcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.  Grab a coffee to read how corporate players are rewriting the Bitcoin (BTC) playbook in real time. As traditional finance (TradFi) norms unravel, bold strategies are emerging to reshape corporate balance sheets and redefine what it means to go all in on digital assets, regardless of risk or reward. Crypto News of the Day: Strategy Rips Up Rulebook on Path to 1 Million Bitcoin, Says Max Keiser Strategy, now MicroStrategy, recently  revealed  a new offering called STRC, or “Stretch.” Marketed as a perpetual preferred stock with an initial 9% dividend, the product is explicitly designed to support the company’s goal of  accumulating more Bitcoin . Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, announced the IPO via X (Twitter), calling it a new lever for Bitcoin accumulation. Strategy’s post echoed the same language,  reaffirming  that net proceeds will go toward general corporate purposes, including acquiring Bitcoin. That mission, however, was punctuated more dramatically in an exclusive comment to BeInCrypto by Bitcoin evangelist Max Keiser. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Moelis &amp; Co., and TD Securities are joint bookrunners, signaling strong institutional coordination.  However, Keiser’s comment cuts through the finance speak, articulating that MicroStrategy does not want more Bitcoin. Rather, it wants all the Bitcoin. This aggressive tone is consistent with Strategy’s decade-long shift from an enterprise software firm to a  Bitcoin holding company . Meanwhile, even as the firm progressively pivots to BTC, analysts say the firm could  trigger a Bitcoin cascade  worse than Mt. Gox or Three Arrows Capital. MARA Raises $850 Million to Double Down on Bitcoin MARA Holdings, the world’s largest public Bitcoin miner, is joining the Bitcoin accumulation wave. The firm revealed a $850 million private offering of convertible senior notes due in 2032. The move signals continued strategic conviction in Bitcoin as a treasury reserve and a core asset in the company’s business model. The offering consists of 0.00% convertible senior notes, with an option for initial purchasers to buy an additional $150 million. Redemption terms kick in from January 2030, and the company has embedded multiple mechanisms to manage dilution. MARA intends to use the bulk of the proceeds to buy additional Bitcoin and fund general corporate purposes. This raise highlights MARA’s role as a miner and digital asset treasury operator. Like Strategy, MARA is positioning itself to amass more Bitcoin while fortifying its balance sheet against future market disruptions. Data on Bitcoin Treasuries shows MARA is a distant second among public corporate holders of BTC, holding 50,000 tokens.  Meanwhile, as of this writing, MicroStrategy is the largest holder, with a 607,770 portfolio valued at $71.80 billion.

      <title>Hyperion announces the official launch of RION Utility, initiating the first phase of the native staking mechanism, RION Staking.Aptos&apos; largest decentralized trading platform, Hyperion, has announced the official launch of the RION Utility prologue, taking the lead in opening the native staking Staking Phase Ⅰ. Users can now lock up $RION to participate in the native staking mechanism, entering the first stage of network construction and value sharing. The total duration of the Staking Phase Ⅰ event is 1 month, and the user&apos;s staking time is based on the actual participation time. The rewards come from part of the platform&apos;s transaction fee revenue. This mechanism is intended to identify and incentivize real contributors, and lay the foundation for more RION application scenarios in the future, while reflecting Hyperion&apos;s high emphasis on real interaction and positive ecological cycles. Hyperion stated that this stage is the first step in unlocking RION Utility, and more utility scenarios based on real revenue will continue to be released in the future. [Odaily News]</title>
