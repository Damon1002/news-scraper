      <title>Institutions: Dollar may fall further as US economic growth slowsInsight Investment analyst Francesca Fornasari said in a report that the dollar may weaken further in the second half of 2025 as U.S. economic growth slows. She said that economic weakness could pave the way for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The dollar&apos;s continued decline as the world&apos;s reserve currency will also put pressure on the dollar. However, given the uncertainty of the U.S. policy outlook and the current aggressive short bets against the dollar, the dollar&apos;s decline should be gradual and moderate.

      <title>More Public Companies Turn to Bitcoin This Week As Corporate Adoption RisesCorporate Bitcoin adoption is gaining momentum, as more publicly listed companies worldwide are shifting their treasury strategies from cash to digital assets. Although investor sentiment varies, the overall market is witnessing growing institutional alignment with Bitcoin as a reserve and strategic asset. Bitcoin Adoption Accelerates as Firms Embrace BTC MicroStrategy (MSTR) remains a notable leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption . The firm recently announced plans to issue 5.00 million Series A STRC preferred shares to raise capital for additional BTC purchases . The capital is intended for working capital needs and explicitly aligns with a long-term Bitcoin reserve strategy . Beyond MicroStrategy, other companies are actively adopting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. US-listed Profusa secured a $100.00 million equity credit line to build a Bitcoin reserve. Similarly, EV startup Volcon acquired over 280 BTC and completed a $500.00 million private funding round to support further accumulation. In Europe, Swedish-listed H100 Group increased its holdings to over 510 BTC after purchasing an additional 140 BTC. Perhaps the most symbolic move comes from Grupo Murano, a major real estate conglomerate in Mexico, which declared Bitcoin a “core strategic asset” with an initial investment of $1.00 billion. This shows a growing corporate consensus that Bitcoin is more than a speculative tool—it is becoming part of global financial policy. Market Signals Support Confidence Recent data shows that public companies’ net purchases of Bitcoin reached $953.00 million last week alone, with MSTR accounting for over $700.00 million. This surge coincides with a sharp increase in Google Trends searches for “ Buy Bitcoin ,” suggesting a revival of retail interest alongside institutional momentum. Overall, corporate Bitcoin adoption reflects a broader financial paradigm shift. Bitcoin is no longer treated as a fringe or experimental asset. From tech to real estate, businesses are increasingly incorporating Bitcoin into their treasury models, not only for diversification but also as a hedge and a symbol of forward-thinking strategy.</title>
