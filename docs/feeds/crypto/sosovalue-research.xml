The U.S. spent $1.1 trillion on interest expenses in 2024, so this claim is almost certainly untrue. (Golden Ten) [Odaily]</title>

      <title>Dow rallies as markets cheer US-Japan trade agreementStocks rallied in early-morning trading on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding more than 200 points at the open. Investors appeared to welcome President Donald Trump’s announcement that the U.S. had reached a trade deal with Japan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 240 points, and the S&amp;P 500 inched higher by 0.4% to extend gains at its record highs. Optimism of potentially more trade agreements ahead of Trump’s Aug. 1 tariffs deadline also saw the Nasdaq Composite edge up, adding a modest 0.16% in early trading. With corporate earnings, spotlighted by Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), set to hit the market after the bell, early cheers had futures across the major U.S. indices flashing rising green. Upbeat sentiment on Wall Street carried through the Asia and European sessions, investors are envisioning the U.S.-Japan deal as a huge one.  In addition to the 15% tariff on Japanese imports, Trump’s administration managed to secure a $550 billion Japanese investment in the U.S.  “There has never been anything like it,” Trump said of the deal in a Truth Social post . “Perhaps most importantly, Japan will open their Country to Trade including Cars and Trucks, Rice and certain other Agricultural Products, and other things. Japan will pay Reciprocal Tariffs to the United States of 15%. This is a very exciting time for the United States of America, and especially for the fact that we will continue to always have a great relationship with the Country of Japan.” The news came as markets weighed the potential impact of fresh trade tensions as the looming Aug. 1 deadline first approaches. However, with U.S. officials noting a likely extension of the Aug. 12 deadline for China, this latest move injects a sense of bullishness for investors. Stocks have shown resilience over the past few months amid tariff uncertainty. Investors also weathered a geopolitical storm in the Middle East. However, none of the headwinds that followed Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs have entirely derailed bulls, with U.S. stocks marching to record highs. Corporate earnings have so far provided buyers with upside fuel, even as more clarity on the tariffs’ impact will become clearer with the release of Google-parent Alphabet’s and electric vehicle giant Tesla’s quarterly earnings reports. Mohamed El-Erian, president of Queen’s College at Cambridge University and chief economic advisor at Allianz, has nonetheless cautioned investors to beware of what’s happening in the bond market.  “While media attention is rightly focused on the Japan-U.S. trade deal, don’t overlook what is happening to the long end of the Japanese bond market where, driven mainly by fiscal concerns, yields continue to climb,” El-Erian noted via X . “With what is a correlated, rather than coordinated, fiscal expansion in the three largest advanced economies — the US, Germany, and Japan — global bond markets have a lot of issuance to digest in the period ahead.”</title>

      <title>Wu Blockchain Daily Crypto News Highlights - Data: The Ethereum validator exit queue is currently around 519,000 ETH, a new high since January 2024.1. Data: Ethereum validator exit queue size is currently about 519,000 ETH, a new high since January 2024

With Ethereum&apos;s year-to-date increase of over 160%, the ETH validator exit queue has surged. Data from the validatorqueue website shows that as of July 23, the number of ETH waiting to exit in the queue has reached 519,000, with a total value of approximately $1.92 billion at the current price, and the waiting time for exit exceeds 9 days, a new high since January 2024. Analysts believe that this round of exits is mainly due to some early stakers choosing to take profits after the price increase. At the same time, due to the continuous entry of ETH treasury-like companies including SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine, the market still shows strong staking demand, and currently 357,000 ETH are waiting to enter the network, with a queuing time of more than 6 days.

2. Arthur Hayes: Year-end target is $250,000 for Bitcoin and $10,000 for Ethereum

Arthur Hayes predicted in his latest blog post that the year-end target is $250,000 for Bitcoin and $10,000 for Ethereum. He said that the upcoming Ethereum bull market will completely detonate the market, and Maelstrom (his personal family office) is doing everything related to Ethereum, DeFi, and ERC-20 shitcoins.

3. South Korean Financial Supervisory Service: Restricting the proportion of corporate ETF investments related to crypto assets

The South Korean financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Service, recently provided oral guidance to local asset management companies, requiring them to control the proportion of investments in crypto asset-related companies such as CoinBase and MicroStrategy in their ETF portfolios, and reiterated that the 2017 &quot;Emergency Measures for Virtual Currencies&quot; is still valid, prohibiting financial institutions from holding, purchasing, or investing in shares of virtual asset-related companies. This move is seen as a response to the recent rapid increase in the weight of &quot;crypto-themed&quot; companies in South Korean ETFs, with the proportion of related constituent stocks in several ETFs currently exceeding 10%.

4. Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon partner to launch tokenized money market fund investment service

Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have jointly launched a new service for institutional investors that allows them to invest in tokenized money market funds through Goldman Sachs&apos; blockchain platform. The project has been joined by several asset management institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity. The two banks stated that the project will lay the foundation for money market funds in a &quot;24/7 real-time trading&quot; digital financial system and is expected to be expanded in the future for use as collateral in financial transactions.</title>

      <title>Institutions: Tariff uncertainty may prompt the ECB to cut interest rates more than onceAccording to a report by Algebris Investments analyst Gabriele Foa, the European Central Bank&apos;s interest rate cuts may exceed current market expectations due to tariff uncertainty. The portfolio manager stated, &quot;Trade tensions and tariff developments may push the end of the easing cycle slightly lower than current market expectations.&quot; LSEG data shows that money markets currently expect the ECB to cut interest rates by another 25 basis points in December. Foa said that the spillover effects of tariffs on Europe may take longer to materialize. (Golden Ten) [Odaily]</title>
