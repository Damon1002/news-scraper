      <title>FinTax Founder: Web3-related crypto income may become a focus of taxation in the futureIn recent years, the data analysis capabilities of tax authorities have significantly improved, and tax bureaus have begun to proactively analyze CRS data. As a Chinese tax resident, if your overseas assets and income are conspicuous enough, you are likely to come into the view of the tax bureau. In the long run, these overseas assets will sooner or later face the attention and management of tax authorities. This reflects the upgrading of the collection and management mechanism—based on specific risk indicators, using internal &quot;five-step work method&quot; and other means to conduct a systematic assessment of the overseas income of natural persons. Currently, common targets of verification include those who invest in Hong Kong and US stocks, and those who realize overseas equity in Internet companies. However, Web3-related crypto income may become one of the focuses in the future. [Securities Times]</title>

      <title>Aave DAO approves Kraken-backed Ink Foundation to launch white-label version of lending protocol in ARFC voteThe Aave DAO has voted in an AFRC vote to enable the Ink Foundation to launch a white-label version of Aave V3. The Ink Foundation is a non-profit organization supporting the Kraken-incubated Ethereum Layer 2 of the same name.

&quot;The Ink Foundation seeks to leverage Aave&apos;s battle-tested infrastructure to create a native lending platform,&quot; Aave DAO&apos;s proposal said. &quot;This partnership represents an opportunity for Aave to expand its influence in the institutional lending space while maintaining its commitment to technological excellence.&quot;

As the proposal passed with 99.8% in favor, the DAO is expected to grant the license for the foundation to launch a rebranded, centralized version of the lending platform that uses Aave&apos;s codebase.

Aave DAO service providers will assist with Ink&apos;s Aave V3 instance for the first six months. In exchange, Aave DAO will receive a share of the new platform&apos;s revenue, equal to or greater than the equivalent of a Reserve Factor of 5% based on borrow volume in all pools.

This initiative will also prevent Ink Foundation and its centralized partners from seeking out other lending protocols for collaborations for a minimum of 12 months after deployment.

On the other hand, the Ink Foundation will dedicate substantial resources to launching and growing this white-label instance of Aave V3, including the introduction of several liquidity mining programs aimed at attracting over $250 million in initial liquidity to the platform.

Meanwhile, Aave V3 is currently deployed across 17 different chains including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base and Polygon, according to DefiLlama data.</title>

      <title>Bank and credit union groups in the US are asking the OCC to delay decisions on bank charter applications submitted by crypto firmsAccording to Cointelegraph, banking and credit union groups in the United States have asked the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to delay decisions on bank charter applications submitted by crypto companies, citing &quot;significant policy and procedural issues.&quot; &quot;There are significant policy and legal questions regarding whether the business plans proposed by the applicants involve the types of fiduciary activities conducted by national trust banks. The public portions of the applications fail to provide sufficient information for the public to assess or meaningfully comment on the applicants’ proposed business models and operations. If the OCC approves these applications, the public should also be able to review the OCC’s decisions.&quot; [Foresight News]</title>
