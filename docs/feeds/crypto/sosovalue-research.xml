      <title>U.S. prosecutors seek to recover $7.1 million in cryptocurrency tied to oil and gas investment fraudOn July 23, according to The Block, the U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office for the Western District of Washington has filed a civil recovery lawsuit for $7.1 million in cryptocurrencies involved in an oil and gas investment fraud case. Prosecutors accused 47-year-old Geoffrey K. Auyeung and his accomplices of deceiving investors into transferring funds to so-called &quot;crude oil tank escrow accounts&quot; and promising to make profits by leasing tank space. The investigation showed that the funds involved were transferred to 81 different accounts, of which $1.9 million was used to purchase assets such as Bitcoin, USDT, USDC and Ethereum through 19 cryptocurrency accounts. Auyeung was indicted for money laundering and other crimes in 2024, and $2.3 million in stolen money in his bank account had been seized. The prosecutor said it would speed up the recovery of funds to compensate the victims. [PANews]</title>

      <title>LetsBonk Grows Market Share to 64% on Solana Meme Token Launch PlatformOn July 23, according to The Block, the market share of LetsBonk, a Meme token launch platform based on Solana, has increased from 5% a month ago to 64% at present, while the market share of competitor Pump.fun has dropped sharply from 90% to 24% during the same period. In the past week, the LetsBonk platform issued a total of about 150,000 tokens, an increase of about 14% from the 132,000 tokens issued in the previous week. Its single-day issuance on July 18 set a new record of 26,600 tokens. In addition, LetsBonk&apos;s trading volume last Friday was about $179 million, while Pump.fun&apos;s was only $52 million. Just a month ago, LetsBonk&apos;s average daily trading volume was less than $10 million, while Pump.fun&apos;s average daily trading volume was almost 15 times that of LetsBonk. The increase in trading volume has led to an increase in fee income. Last week alone, LetsBonk generated more than $8 million in fee income. During the same period, Pump.fun&apos;s fee income was only about half of that. [PANews]</title>

      <title>How GameSquare is monetizing a $38.00M Ether treasury with NFTsWhile most firms treat NFTs as marketing gimmicks, GameSquare is flipping the script, deploying them as financial instruments. Its new $10.00 million yield program transforms Ethereum-based digital assets into revenue generators, marking a risky but innovative leap in corporate crypto strategy. On July 21, GameSquare announced the expansion of its crypto treasury program to $250.00 million, including a dedicated $10.00 million allocation toward a novel NFT yield strategy. The move follows a $30.00 million purchase of Ether ( ETH ), bringing its total holdings to over 10,000 tokens. Rather than holding these assets passively, the company plans to actively deploy them across Ethereum-native DeFi protocols, using NFTs not as collectibles but as yield-bearing instruments. The strategy is backed by risk management infrastructure developed in partnership with Swiss crypto firm Dialectic. The announcement positions GameSquare among a rare breed of public companies experimenting with NFTs as functional components of corporate finance. It reflects a broader evolution in digital asset strategy, moving away from speculative balance sheet positioning toward operational capital deployment. GameSquare’s decision to focus its digital asset strategy on Ethereum signals a fundamental shift in how the company views the role of capital within a modern media business. Ethereum’s capacity to be programmed, staked, lent, or locked in smart contracts is being used as the backbone of a treasury system that does more than just store value. With $35.00 million already deployed into ETH and another $215.00 million authorized, GameSquare is treating its crypto holdings not as hedges, but as financial infrastructure. The NFT angle reveals GameSquare’s deeper play. Rather than chasing hype-driven collectibles, the company is strategically acquiring Ethereum-native digital assets that align with its gaming and media roots. By locking NFTs into DeFi protocols, GameSquare can mint yield-bearing stablecoins while retaining ownership of the underlying assets. “We are excited to be among the first public companies to include NFTs as part of a diversified digital asset strategy,” the company’s CEO, Justin Kenna, said. “This reflects the innovative approach to our treasury management initiatives. With deep experience building in-game and real-world creative environments, GameSquare is uniquely positioned to understand the cultural and economic value of these digital assets.” According to the press release, GameSquare has established a dedicated crypto investment committee reporting directly to its board, with strict controls to prevent conflicts of interest.</title>

      <title>Tesla’s futuristic diner is here, serving fries and popcorn—but where’s the Dogecoin?Elon Musk’s Tesla diner is now serving up burgers and futurism in Hollywood. However, patrons noticed the absence of Dogecoin payments, despite his earlier endorsement, turning what could’ve been a crypto milestone into a missed opportunity. The grand opening of Tesla’s long-hyped “retro-futuristic” diner in Hollywood unfolded Monday afternoon with all the usual Musk theatrics: a 4:20 p.m. unlock time, robots behind popcorn machines, and Cybertruck-shaped trays. Tesla Diner &amp; Supercharger in Hollywood, LA Open 24/7, starting now  pic.twitter.com/nISRNoV89Y The crowd, which had gathered at the Santa Monica Boulevard diner hours before opening, cheered as Tesla’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, unlocked the doors.  For Dogecoin ( DOGE ) loyalists, the fanfare rang hollow. Despite Musk’s 2022 tweet insisting DOGE payments were coming, the only currency accepted was the old-fashioned kind. When one patron approached a touch screen and placed his order, he followed up with a question: “Can I pay in Dogecoin?” “Not today,” the diner employee responded. See below. 🚨DOGE FAM MUST SEE THIS🚨 I actually went to Tesla Diner first day to ask them if they accept DOGECOIN! 👇  pic.twitter.com/3b7zeDhhsA Musk’s influence on Dogecoin’s valuation is well-documented; a single tweet from him has sent the memecoin soaring or cratering for years. His latest pivot away from crypto integration, especially at a high-profile venture blending tech and commerce, raises questions about how seriously Tesla takes digital assets. The diner’s omission of DOGE isn’t just a snub to crypto enthusiasts; it’s a missed chance to normalize cryptocurrency in everyday transactions, something Musk once championed. The Tesla diner, nestled at the intersection of electric vehicles, entertainment, and lifestyle, could have become a high-visibility proving ground for real-world crypto payments. Killing it, man! “Not today” paying with  $Doge . Not the answer we where hoping for but better then a flat out no Instead, the absence of Dogecoin underscores a widening gap between Musk’s rhetoric and implementation, particularly at a time when the digital assets sector is seeking tangible, everyday use cases. Whether this was a delay or a quiet reversal remains unclear, but in the current climate, silence on crypto can speak volumes. Meanwhile, Musk has already floated plans to expand the diner concept to major cities and Supercharger stops, contingent on its initial success. Whether he’ll keep his word and eventually accept DOGE as a payment remains to be seen.  “‘Not today’ paying with $Doge. Not the answer we where hoping for but better then a flat out no,” another observer noted on X [sic].</title>

      <title>US Prosecutors Seek Forfeiture of $7.10M in Crypto Assets Tied to Fake Oil and Gas Investment ScamThe U.S. Attorney&apos;s Office for the Western District of Washington announced that it has filed a civil lawsuit regarding a fraud case involving false oil and gas storage investments, seeking to seize approximately $7.10M in cryptocurrency in order to return some of the losses to victims. The related assets were seized by Homeland Security Investigations in December 2024. The total amount of funds involved is approximately $97.00M. The fraudulent group lured victims into remitting funds by disguising themselves as third-party escrow accounts and transferred the funds into multiple financial institutions and cryptocurrency accounts.

      <title>PENGU Could Rally 38% if One Key Price Resistance BreaksAfter a strong 26% gain over the past week, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is now hovering just below a crucial resistance level. While much of the altcoin market cools down, PENGU price looks poised to break out. Only if it can push past one key wall. A deeper look at bullish strength, liquidations, and price charts shows the token might still have room to run. PENGU Bulls Are In Complete Control Even though PENGU dropped around 2% in the past 24 hours, the bulls still seem to be holding the reins. The Bull-Bear Power (BBP) index, which compares recent highs and lows to measure market strength, is currently flashing green, at around 0.0148. This level suggests buyers still have the upper hand, despite a short-term dip. For token TA and market updates : Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter  here . In simple terms, when BBP is positive, bulls are stronger than bears. And Pengu’s BBP has remained above zero since late June, even as prices hovered below key resistance. That steady strength could be a sign that any dip is just part of a cooldown before another leg up. If BBP stays positive while price climbs past resistance, it might confirm that PENGU still has momentum. But if BBP flips negative, it could warn of a deeper pullback ahead. 7-Day Liquidation Map Shows Short-Biased Setup PENGU is currently trading around $0.036. The 7-day liquidation map shows cumulative short liquidation leverage building up to $10.46 million versus $10.18 million for longs; a slight bias toward short positions. Do note that there isn’t much to choose between Longs and  Shorts , and a price push in either direction can decide the next leg for PENGU.  However, as bulls are in power and that too by a sizable margin, as established by the BBP index, the price action could impact the short positions more than the long. If the price crosses $0.039, led by bulls breaking key resistance level, and even nears $0.042, a major liquidation cluster of shorts gets triggered. That would reduce downward pressure and potentially propel the  PENGU price  to the next key price level. The liquidation map shows a build-up of short positions; if PENGU’s price moves up fast, those betting against it may be forced to buy back, pushing the price even higher. PENGU Price Action Hints at a 38% Upside Technically, the  PENGU price  has tested the 0.382 Fibonacci level near $0.039 twice and failed to break above cleanly. It now trades just under that resistance. Do note that besides the Fib extension resistance, a key resistance of $0.037 also exists. The chart uses the Trend-based Fibonacci extension tool. It connects the swing low of $0.0077 to the last swing high of $0.035 and then to the immediately retraced price level of $0.028. This tool helps chart the next price targets for a coin/token in an uptrend.  If PENGU price manages a clean breakout above $0.037, $0.039, and then $0.042 (the 0.5 Fib zone), it opens the path to $0.045 first, a 25% surge. If that breaks, the next key resistance point, or rather target, would be $0.050, the 0.786 Fibonacci level. That would be a 38% rally from current prices around $0.036. Validation for this move comes from declining bear power, building short positions, and strong chart structure. The bullish trend would get invalidated if PENGU breaks the $0.035 resistance-turned-support. Or if it continues to drop to touch the retracement zone of the Fibonacci extension: the $0.028 mark.</title>

      <title>Orphanage in Uganda That Runs on Bitcoin Celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day with a Road TripOn May 22, 2025, children from the Orphans of Uganda Children’s Center, an orphanage in eastern Uganda that’s part of the Bitcoin Kampala community, took a road trip to the zoo thanks in part to bitcoin donations from around the world. The team that helps fund and run the the orphanage chose to take the trip on Bitcoin Pizza Day to show the orphans, many of whom had never left the village in which the orphanage is located, that anything is possible, much like Laszlo Hanyecz showed the world that paying for goods and services in bitcoin is possible when he paid 10,000 bitcoin for two pizzas on May 22, 2010. 22•05•2025 – Orphanage Bitcoin Pizza Day 😇 We dreamt to leave our district on a bus to the zoo at the end of last year, you all made it happen…. Special Thanks to @blinkbtc , @studentofbtc , @travelwbitcoin who sponsored us for the day And our forever patrons @Bitcoinbeach ,… pic.twitter.com/Ol6XC52bcv “We organized this trip to give the children hope and to open their minds to what’s possible,” Brindon Mwiine, founder of Bitcoin Kampala, told Bitcoin Magazine. “Last year, we started teaching them to write down their dreams in notebooks we gave them, and when we asked what they wished for at Christmas, their answers were simple: visit the capital, see animals, and travel,” he added. “Bitcoin Pizza Day at the Entebbe Zoo became the perfect way to bring those dreams to life while teaching them about Bitcoin.” Mwiine also noted that this was the first time the children had taken an extended bus ride, crossed the Nile, traveled through the capital city of Kampala, explored a zoo — and tasted pizza. “It was a day of firsts,” said Mwiine, who added that it was all the more special because he, the support staff and the children “experienced it all together as a family.” Edith Mpumwire, a member of Blink Wallet’s marketing team and someone who works with the Bitcoin Kampala team, seconded what Mwiine said. “This trip is the first of its kind [for these children],” said Mpumwire in the video embedded in the X post above. “Most of these children are from eastern Uganda [and] they stay in a small house located in Bugiri. They have never left Bugiri, so, for them, today is the first day to not only visit the zoo, but to leave their enclosure,” she added. Mpumwire also noted how the international Bitcoin community is partially to thank for enabling the orphans to take this trip. “The global [Bitcoin] community contributes to their livelihood [and] here we are taking them on a road trip [where] they get to see a mini national park, Lake Victoria and very many animals.” You can contribute to the Orphans of Uganda Children’s Center via the project’s Geyser page.</title>

      <title>KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings File with SEC, Merger Expected to Close August 11Today, KindlyMD (NASDAQ: NAKA) and Bitcoin-native firm Nakamoto Holdings announced that it has officially filed their definitive information statement with the SEC in connection with the proposed merger with Nakamoto, moving forward with a planned merger expected to close around August 11, 2025. BREAKING: 🇺🇸 $763.00 million #Bitcoin treasury company Nakamoto files with SEC to merge with publicly traded KindlyMD. Expects to complete the merge in 20 days. pic.twitter.com/ejjMaoqI6k “Filing the definitive information statement is a critical milestone for this merger and accelerates our mission of acquiring one million Bitcoin,” stated the Founder and CEO of Nakamoto David Bailey. “I’m very proud of the teams’ collaboration at Nakamoto and KindlyMD to get us one step closer to closing the merger. Our shared enthusiasm for Bitcoin paired with our expertise in structuring this opportunity for public markets has created a strong foundation for the combined company’s future.” The merger is a key step in advancing Nakamoto’s strategy, which will use Bitcoin not only as a reserve asset but as the foundation of a new capital framework. Nakamoto will treat Bitcoin as the base and combine it with public stocks to grow and invest more effectively. This model supports smaller companies that hold Bitcoin in regions where direct access to it is limited. Firms like Metaplanet, Smarter Web Company, and The Blockchain Group have already shown strong results. Performance is measured by Bitcoin per share, with gains reinvested into more Bitcoin or new ventures. Nakamoto manages the 40 percent securities limit under the Investment Company Act by using Bitcoin-denominated convertible notes, giving it more flexibility and control. With over 750 million dollars raised, the merger with KindlyMD supports its goal of expanding a Bitcoin based financial model globally. “We are proud to reach this important milestone alongside Nakamoto,” said the Founder and CEO of KindlyMD Tim Pickett. “Our shareholders now have the opportunity to be part of a groundbreaking shift in how public companies approach treasury management, with Bitcoin at the center.” Disclosure: Nakamoto is in partnership with Bitcoin Magazine’s parent company BTC Inc to build the first global network of Bitcoin treasury companies, where BTC Inc provides certain marketing services to Nakamoto.

Citadel said that tokenized equities should follow the same regulatory rules as traditional securities, and that the SEC should advance relevant policies through roundtables and formal rulemaking, rather than circumventing existing regulations through &quot;innovation exceptions.&quot; [The Block]</title>

      <title>The Opendoor Meme Frenzy Isn’t the Next GameStopOpendoor Technologies Inc., a purveyor of residential real estate, has sextupled thus far in July with little news to justify the surge. Investors left the company for dead a few years ago when the housing market froze up, and Wall Street was starting to forget that it even existed. The company received a Nasdaq delisting notice because its stock price had been hovering below the minimum-price requirement of $1. Then a few weeks ago, the stock started to perk up, and an Opendoor bull named Eric Jackson started attracting attention on social media. Now, it has a market cap of $2.3 billion, and people are asking themselves if it’s indicative of froth in the broader US equity market.I doubt it.</title>

      <title>Telegram launches non-custodial crypto app in USMessaging app Telegram has launched a new non-custodial crypto wallet in the United States through a partnership with MoonPay. The new feature will enable millions of users to send and manage crypto directly within the app.

Telegram previously launched a crypto wallet globally that was activated by more than 100 million users. Tuesday’s launch will enable users in the U.S. to send, receive, and manage cryptocurrency directly inside the app.

The wallet is built on The Open Platform, a.k.a. TOP, which is built on the TON blockchain. The feature allows users to transact with crypto as easily as sending a message. Telegram said that the wallet will be instantly installed and will not require a download.

The Open Platform recently raised a $28.5 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation.

Telegram infamously fought the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in court after launching its TON token in 2019. After a protracted legal battle, Telegram agreed to return $1.2 billion to investors and pay an $18.5 million penalty to settle with the SEC.</title>

      <title>DevvStream pivots, anchors crypto treasury to BTC and SOLNasdaq-listed carbon management firm DevvStream unveiled Tuesday the initial composition of its digital asset treasury, naming Bitcoin, Solana and its own DevvE token as core holdings. The company also appointed BitGo as its qualified custodian and brought in FRNT Financial as a digital asset advisor, signaling a deliberate move to pair ESG mandates with programmable finance. DevvStream CEO Sunny Trinh said the company’s crypto treasury strategy is less about speculative upside and more about institutional-grade liquidity, ecosystem alignment, and real-world asset integration. “Our treasury model isn’t just about holding crypto. It’s about aligning capital with our mission,” Trinh said. “Our mix of assets is designed to deliver institutional-grade efficiency and income, while bridging to sustainability tokenization and real-world asset integration. Together, they position DevvStream at the intersection of liquidity, innovation, and impact.” Bitcoin (BTC), described by the company as the “foundational asset of the digital economy,” serves as the bedrock of its treasury, offering deep liquidity and institutional credibility. Unlike firms that treat BTC purely as a hedge, DevvStream appears to view it as an on-ramp for broader blockchain integration, ensuring stability while it experiments with more dynamic assets. Solana’s (SOL) inclusion is equally deliberate. The company cited SOL’s transaction speed and ecosystem depth as key factors, suggesting an intent to generate yield through staking or DeFi participation. This is a departure from passive Bitcoin holdings, aligning with a growing trend of corporations leveraging proof-of-stake networks for treasury management, where idle assets can earn returns without traditional market risks. But the most unconventional pick is DevvE, the company’s proprietary token. Unlike BTC and SOL, DevvE isn’t just a store of value or yield vehicle; it’s designed to facilitate what the firm calls “impact-layer tokenization,” linking digital finance directly to carbon offset projects and other sustainability initiatives. The company hasn’t disclosed exact allocation percentages.</title>
