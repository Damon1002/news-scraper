      <title>Vitalik Buterin touts &apos;safe&apos; scaling as Ethereum gas limit ticks upEthereum&apos;s per-block gas limit has begun to rise as validators representing nearly a majority of staked ETH signal their support to &quot;pump the gas&quot;, allowing for higher transaction throughput on the Layer 1 blockchain.

Several Ethereum blocks on Sunday afternoon were proposed with a gas limit above 39 million units, an 8% rise from the 36 million prior limit. The gas limit has been 36 million since February, when it was raised for the first time in over three years from its prior value of 30 million.

Ethereum&apos;s gas serves as a measure of the computational and storage work demanded by transactions or smart contracts on the network. The gas limit caps the amount of processing power demanded by any one block, ensuring the blockchain can still operate in periods of high demand.

Raising the gas limit serves to increase throughput on the network during times of high activity, since more transactions can be included in each block, proposed roughly every twelve seconds. However, larger gas limits can make it more difficult for smaller validators to run nodes, given the increased processing costs.

&quot;If the gas limit is raised too high we could create a scenario where the chain becomes too large for solo node operators to validate and download,&quot; representatives of the &quot;pump the gas&quot; effort have written. &quot;Technology improves however and it does make sense to slowly increase it as time goes on.&quot;

Once validators signal their desire to increase the block limit, the limit automatically rises; each block can adjust the limit by around 0.1% of the previous total. According to the dashboard gaslimit.pics, around 48% of staked ETH is currently running clients whose gas limit target is 45  million units or higher, so the blocks they propose vote the limit upward. The initiative has been promoted among certain Ethereum communities as a call to &quot;pump the gas.&quot;

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin flagged the move in an X post on Sunday.&quot;Almost exactly 50% of stake is voting to increase the L1 gas limit to 45m,&quot; he noted.

Buterin also highlighted a recent version of Geth, the most popular Ethereum node client with a 54% market share, which reduced the storage size of a pruned archive node by about 90%, from over 20 TB to around 2 TB. Buterin called the effort, &quot;...recent hard work by the Geth team that makes these kinds of scale increases safe.&quot;

      <title>Bitcoin Treasury Capital CEO: I learned about Bitcoin while studying Chinese in ShanghaiOn July 20, Bitcoin Treasury Capital CEO Christoffer De Geer published an article on the X platform, revealing that he needed to remit money to Sweden when he was studying Chinese in Shanghai in 2013. When he was looking for alternatives, he accidentally learned about Bitcoin. As a Swede in China, he found a 12-year-old Bitcoin miner and began to learn about wallets, keys, UTXO, block browsers, and an anonymous person named Satoshi Nakamoto.
Today, Bitcoin Treasury Capital already holds 156 bitcoins and has reached an equity financing agreement of up to 200 million Swedish kronor with a group of investors. It has also been approved for listing and trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with the stock code X4L. Bitcoin Treasury Capital will continue its Bitcoin financial strategy. [PANews]</title>

      <title>U.S. Commerce Secretary Lutnick: Powell is keeping interest rates too high; August 1 is the deadline for imposing tariffsOn July 20, according to Jinshi, U.S. Commerce Secretary Lutnick said that Powell kept interest rates too high. August 1 is the deadline for imposing tariffs. Small countries must pay a 10% base tariff.

      <title>British media says stablecoins are fraught with risks and may provide an opportunity for money launderingOn July 20, according to the Financial Times, US President Trump signed the Stablecoin Regulatory Act on the 18th. This is the first stablecoin legislation in the United States at the federal level. However, the development of stablecoins has hidden risks and how it will reshape the financial ecosystem. The cross-border flow of funds in stablecoins is anonymous, making it difficult for regulators to effectively track the flow of funds and accurately count the scale of funds. This provides opportunities for illegal financial activities such as money laundering, greatly increasing the difficulty of supervision. In countries and regions with weak financial systems, the widespread use of stablecoins will inevitably have a strong impact on the local financial system. Once a stablecoin crisis occurs, it is very easy to trigger a chain of market confidence crises, which in turn leads to the outbreak of bank runs. [PANews]</title>
