Ghana Plans to Issue Licenses to Cryptocurrency PlatformsThe Bank of Ghana plans to submit a draft regulatory framework for crypto platforms to parliament by September, intending to issue licenses to virtual asset platforms to regulate the crypto trading market involving millions of users in the country, obtain financial data, and enhance cross-border trade capabilities. The central bank governor stated that the lack of regulation has led to a large number of crypto transactions not being included in the official financial system, affecting the local currency, the Cedi.

The old man transferred a total of HK$3,272,700.00 in 37 transactions to 34 bank accounts provided by the woman.

The old man lost more than HK$3.27 million in total and owed nearly one million in debt as a result. The Hong Kong police said that they had received nearly 20 online romance scams related to investment in the past two weeks, with 40% of the victims being over 60 years old, with a total loss of more than HK$10.00 million.</title>

      <title>$TRUMP Goes Live On TRON NetworkJuly 24, 2025 - Geneva, Switzerland - TRON DAO, a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps, announced today the official deployment of $TRUMP on the TRON blockchain. The token expansion is enabled by LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard and Stargate Finance’s user interface and liquidity transport protocol. Together, they provide a framework for cross-chain transfers of $TRUMP while maintaining a unified supply. This development positions TRON at the forefront of the evolving digital asset landscape, where real-world value transfer, speed, and accessibility are critical to mainstream growth.

The deployment of $TRUMP on TRON introduces the token to one of the most actively used blockchain networks in the world. TRON hosts over 321 million user accounts and over $20 billion in daily transfer volume, with a circulating supply of more than $80 billion in USDT on the network. Its infrastructure is optimized for high-speed and low-cost transactions, making it an ideal blockchain for a token like $TRUMP that seeks to scale across everyday use cases—from DeFi engagement to community activations and potentially real-world payments.

“TRON is built to support scale, inclusion, and real-world use,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “The launch of $TRUMP on TRON reflects our belief in giving community-powered assets a network that can help them thrive globally.”

LayerZero’s integration plays a critical role in this launch, offering secure and seamless cross-chain functionality through its Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. This allows $TRUMP to move across supported blockchains without relying on traditional bridges or wrapped assets, reducing fragmentation and increasing accessibility. Stargate Finance, a liquidity network for cross-chain transfer for assets built on top of LayerZero protocol, supports $TRUMP bridging to and from TRON, further strengthening its liquidity and multichain utility.

By bringing $TRUMP into the TRON ecosystem, TRON DAO plans to explore DeFi and payment utility to the token as they continue to champion a vision of open, scalable blockchain infrastructure that supports emerging digital assets and unlocks new channels for community and financial participation. The commitment reinforces TRON DAO’s commitment to expanding its reach through innovative, user-centric initiatives that align with the decentralized ethos of the crypto space. With the addition of $TRUMP, TRON continues to prove itself as a dynamic technology for the next generation of token-based innovation.
